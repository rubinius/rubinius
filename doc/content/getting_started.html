Getting Started
===============

This guide will help you get Rubinius running. It assumes you know something
about Ruby and about installing software on your system.

If you have trouble following the directions here, visit the #rubinius IRC
channel on irc.freenode.net for help.

Requirements
------------

Ensure you have the following programs and libraries installed. Also see the
subsections below for special requirements for your particular operating
system.

The following are suggestions for getting more information about the programs
and libraries needed to build Rubinius. Your operating system or package
manager may have other packages available.

  * [GCC and G++ 4.x](http://gcc.gnu.org/)
  * [GNU Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
  * [MRI Ruby 1.8.7+](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) If your system does not have
    Ruby 1.8.7 installed, consider using [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
    to install it.
  * [Rubygems](http://www.rubygems.org/)
  * [Git](http://git.or.cz/)
  * [ZLib](http://www.zlib.net/)
  * pthread - The pthread library should be installed by your operating system
  * [gmake](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/)
  * [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) `[sudo] gem install rake`


### Apple OS X

The easiest way to get a build environment on Apple OS X is to install the
XCode Tools and Utilities. Once installed, you can enable developer mode crash
reporting at: /Developer/Applications/Utilities/CrashReporterPrefs.app


### Debian/Ubuntu

  * ruby-dev or ruby1.8-dev
  * libreadline5-dev
  * zlib1g-dev
  * libssl-dev


Building Rubinius
-----------------

You can build and run Rubinius from the source directory. You do not need to
install Rubinius to run it. The directions below will detail both installing
Rubinius and running it from the source directory.

Rubinius uses LLVM for the JIT compiler. Rubinius depends on a particular
version of LLVM. If you have installed LLVM on your system, pass the
'--skip-system' flag to the configure script in the directions below.

### Getting the Source

The Rubinius source code available as a tarball and as a project on Github.
You can [download the tarball here](http://rubini.us/download/latest).

To use Git:

  1. Change your current working directory to your development directory
  2. `git clone git://github.com/evanphx/rubinius.git`


### Installing Rubinius

If you are planning on using Rubinius to run your application, this is a good
option. However, you can also run Rubinius directly from the source directory.
See the next section for more details on that.

We recommend installing Rubinius to a location that does not require `sudo` or
superuser privileges. To install Rubinius:

  1. `./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir`
  2. `rake install`
  3. Follow the directions to add the Rubinius _bin_ directory to your PATH


### Running from the Source Directory

If you plan to work on Rubinius itself, you should use this option.

  1. `./configure`
  2. `rake`

If you are just trying out Rubinius, follow the directions to add the _bin_
directory to your PATH.

However, if you are developing Rubinius, you should NOT add the _bin_
directory to your PATH because the Rubinius build system will pick up the
`ruby` and `rake` links to the Rubinius executable. Rubinius needs a separate
Ruby executable to bootstrap itself during the build process.


Running Rubinius
----------------

Once you have followed the steps for building (and possibly installing)
Rubinius, you can verify it is working:

    rbx -v

Rubinius generally works like Ruby from the command-line. For example:

    rbx -e 'puts "Hello!"'

To run a ruby file named 'code.rb':

    rbx code.rb

To run IRB:

    rbx

If you added the Rubinius bin directory to your PATH, Rubinius should perform
just as you would expect from MRI. There are commands for `ruby`, `rake`,
`gem`, `irb`, `ri`, and `rdoc`.

You can add the Rubinius bin directory to your PATH only when you want to use
Rubinius. This way, it will not interfere with your normally installed Ruby
when you do not want to use Rubinius.


Troubleshooting
---------------

channel on irc.freenode.net.
