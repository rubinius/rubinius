We want to start off by saying thank you for using Rubinius. This project is a
labor of love, and we appreciate all of the users that catch bugs, make
performance improvements, and help with documentation. Every contribution is
meaningful, so thank you for participating. That being said, here are a few
guidelines that we ask you to follow so we can successfully address your issue.

1. Submitting Issues

Please include the following:

* The Rubinius version (rbx -v)
* Your OS (uname -a) RVM/rbenv/chruby/etc version or the commit hash from git
  if you're building off of a clone
* Stack trace (preferably as a gist, since they're easier to read) If you can
  add a failing spec, that's great!
* Please include the simplest possible reproduction you can. This last point is
  vital to fixing issues.
  
If you are unable to build from source, please also include

* configure.log
* config.rb

Regarding the formatting of the README:

The Rubinius team will not merge pull requests that change the formatting of
the README to Markdown. The intent of the README is to give a basic
understanding of the project in a platform-independent format that renders
well on all devices, as a plain text document. Please see #859 & #1007 for
the specific reasoning.

2. Running Specs

MSpec provides several different scripts to run the specs under different
conditions. The default behavior is to simply run all the specs. If you invoke
the following command, it will run all the Ruby Array specs:

  bin/mspec core/array

The -t option specifies which Ruby implementation to run the specs under. The
default in Rubinius is to run them with Rubinius, so -tx is implied. You can
easily run with another target by giving the name of an executable on your
PATH or the full path to an executable. Since the specs are intended to show
the behavior of MRI, if you are writing new specs you need to run them under
the current stable release of MRI 2.0. For example, if you have a ruby2.0.0
executable on your PATH, you can do the following:

  bin/mspec -t ruby2.0.0 core/array

Finally, if you are running bin/mspec in the Rubinius source directory, the
location of the RubySpecs are known (spec/ruby/), so you can use the full path
or the shortened version core/array above.

3. Fixing a bug

* Fork the repo, create a topic branch, and include a spec, if appropriate.
  Pull requests that need a spec but are submitted without one will be delayed
  until one is written. The spec should be in a separate commit.
* Please follow the Coding Style Guide at
  http://rubini.us/doc/en/contributing/style-guide
* ALWAYS RUN THE FULL SPEC SUITE! 'rake' will run the VM specs plus RubySpec.
* Please add a * detailed commit message. Here is a fantastic example by
  @ryoqun https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/commit/1f9ddd1
  The preference is for a (max) 50 character summary as line one, a blank line,
  then any number of lines, no longer than 80 characters.
* Send in that pull request!
* Follow up with us on the ticket if we haven't merged or commented in a few
  days. We strive to address issues in a reasonable time. If we miss yours,
  please remind us.

4. Performance patches

We love these!

* Include benchmarks before and after the change. Please include your hardware
  specs, namely CPU speed, # of cores, speed of hard drive (if SSD, then SSD is
  fine) and amount of RAM.
* ALWAYS RUN THE FULL SPEC SUITE! 'rake' will ensure you didn't accidentally
  break anything.
