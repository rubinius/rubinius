This file documents changes made in each version that may be of interest to
users. The description is high-level and focuses on visible behavior rather
than implementation details. The content here is not intended to provide
documentation for features. See http://rubini.us/documentation.

The Changelog file provides summaries of changes that affect behavior but not
typically changes that are related to specs, build system, or refactoring.

For source changes, see https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/commits/master.

Version: 2.4.0 (2014-12-01)

* File.fnmatch support for FNM_EXTGLOB has been added.

* Marshal handles immediate values returned by custom _dump methods.

* Kernel#caller_locations has been added. Kernel#caller now supports a limit
  argument.

* Errno classes can be subclassed.

* An issue caused by the god monitoring facility, where god would forcefully
  close all file descriptors in the process from 3 to 256, has been mitigated.
  Previously, this issue could cause Rubinius to hang when running god and
  exec'ing a subprocess.

* Rubinius::Metrics.data.to_hash now re-uses a Hash instance instead of
  creating a new one on every call.

Version 2.3.0 (2014-10-31)

* Keyword arguments (both optional and required) are supported. Other syntax
  changes in MRI 2.1, like Complex and Rational literal suffixes and symbol
  list literals, are also supported.

* Rubinius will read -X configuration options from CWD/.rbxrc. The format of
  the file is one -X configuration option per line. The available -X
  configuration options are listed by the -Xhelp option.

* The basic infrastructure has been added for always-on metrics of Rubinius
  subsystems. The metrics are 64bit monotonic counters. The data is accessible
  with 'Rubinius::Metrics.data'. The object returned provides the following
  methods:

    * keys: return a list of symbol keys that name available metrics.
    * values: return the values of the available metrics.
    * []: return the value of the metric specified by the given key.
    * to_hash: return a Hash instance of the available metrics.

  The metrics can be emitted to StatsD at a regular interval. See the
  following -X configuration options:

    * system.metrics.interval
    * system.metrics.target
    * system.metrics.statsd.server
    * system.metrics.statsd.prefix

  The available metrics will be refined over time. Check the values returned
  by the 'Rubinius::Metrics.data.keys' method to determine which metrics are
  available.

* Rubinius provides an interface to the syslog facility. This is used
  internally in Rubinius subsystems to standardize logging. Since the syslog
  interface available through libc only allows syslog to be opened once in a
  process, Rubinius provides the Rubinius::Logger class as a way for
  applications to use the same handle to syslog but provide a specific prefix
  for the application (or application components).

    * Logger.system: return new logger using the "system" prefix.
    * Logger.log_exception(message, exc): write a rendered exception with the
      system logger prefix.
    * Logger.new(name): return a new logger using the specified prefix.
    * Logger#fatal(message): write message to both STDERR and the log with a
      level of Fatal.
    * Logger#error(message): write message to the log with level of Error.
    * Logger#warn(message): write message to the log with level of Warn.
    * Logger#info(message): write message to the log with level of Info.
    * Logger#debug(message): write message to the log with level of Debug.

  The default level that will be written to the log is Warn or higher. To
  change the log level, use the system.log.level -X configuration option.

  The system.log -X configuration variable controls which logger is used. The
  available loggers are syslog, console, or path. The default logger is the
  file /var/log/$PROGRAM_NAME.log, where $PROGRAM_NAME is replaced by the
  value of Rubinius::PROGRAM_NAME. If this file is not writable,
  $TMPDIR/$PROGRAM_NAME.log (where TMPDIR is an environment variable) or
  /tmp/$PROGRAM_NAME.log will be used, if writable.

  If using another application component that opens syslog, this will
  interfere with Rubinius using syslog. In this scenario, consider using the
  Rubinius::Logger class in your application.

* The infrastructure for Rubinius::Console has been added. Rubinius::Console
  will eventually replace IRB, the Rubinius debugger and profiler, and all the
  Rubinius::Agent features, including heap dump. Many of the Rubinius::Console
  features have not yet been implemented.

  The Rubinius::Console supports attaching to any running Rubinius instance as
  long as read/write access is available to the file system path specified by
  the system.fsapi.path -X configuration option. Accordingly, Console relies
  on the OS process and file system permissions to provide security and access
  control. With a utility like sshfs, Console can connect to a running
  Rubinius instance over the network.

  The goal of Console is to provide a single, comprehensive, integrated, and
  powerful interface to the behavior of the Rubinius system and applications
  running on it.

* Support for automatically building LLVM from source, or accessing a
  pre-built binary of LLVM has been removed. Effort is being focused on
  supporting LLVM packages provided by the system. This is a better use of
  time and allows Rubinius to better integrate with existing systems. For
  example, many Linux distributions strenuously discourage alternately
  packaging system libraries to reduce security risks when defects in the
  libraries are detected and fixed.
