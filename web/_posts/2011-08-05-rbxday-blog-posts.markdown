With just a few hours left in the first [#rbxday](http://rbxday.rubini.us),
I wanted to share a few blog posts that people have written for today.
It seems like lots of people are having lots of fun all while using Rubinius.
That&rsquo;s what really matters.

And I think [Andrew W. K.](http://twitter.com/andrewwk)
would probably be proud of that.

Onto the blog posts...

Chris White [compares bytecode](http://rubysource.blogspot.com/2011/08/taking-byte-out-of-ruby.html "A Source For All Things Ruby: Taking A Byte Out of Ruby")
from MRI, JRuby and Rubinius:

Finally, there&rsquo;s the
[Rubysfera blog](http://rubysfera.pl/2011/08/kod-zrodlowy-rubiego-w-rubym/ "Kod źródłowy Rubiego w Rubym")
that&rsquo;s not written in a language that I can read. So, I&rsquo;ll just assume that
they&rsquo;re talking about Chocolate Rubinius Cake and how to bake it. ;)

*Seriously though, I have no idea what that post says.
If you do, please let me know.*

There&rsquo;s still time. Go test your app running on Rubinius. Tweet about it.
