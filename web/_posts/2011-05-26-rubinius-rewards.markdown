## tl;dr

Email [community@rubini.us](mailto:community@rubini.us) to get stickers and
t-shirts. Include your mailing address.

## We Made T-Shirts and Stickers

We heard you like stickers and t-shirts, so we made some. They
debuted at [RailsConf 2011 in Baltimore, MD](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2011 "RailsConf 2011 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 16 - 19, 2011, Baltimore, MD!").
Then we gave almost all of them away in just a few hours. They went like
hotcakes. It turns out that there was a lot of pent up demand for Rubinius
swag.

Not everyone could be at RailsConf to get the goods, of course. Even some
people who were there didn't get their shirts/stickers. If you didn't get one
and want one, we're very sorry, but don't you worry. We've got you covered.


## General Availability Stickers

## First Commit Sticker

Going forward, we want to reward everyone who makes a contribution to
Rubinius. As a very small token of our gratitude, we're mailing a Rubinius
sticker (and a handwritten thank you note from one of us) to everyone after
their first commit. So, if you've ever thought about dipping your toe into
Rubinius (or diving headlong into the deep end), now's the best time ever.
Help us make Rubinius better (in big and small ways) and we'll send you stuff.


## Tenth Commit Shirt

We want you to stick around and keep helping Rubinius to get better and better.
If you make 10 commits to Rubinius, we'll send you a special shirt only
available to committers. That design is still a secret for now, but it's just
for 10+ committers.

*Please, don't try to game the system by intentionally breaking stuff up into
smaller commits just to bump up your count. Let's keep it honest.*


## Quarterly Committer Merit Badge Stickers

In addition to getting a generally available sticker after your first commit,
at the end of each calendar quarter (every three months) we're sending a
sticker to everyone who committed to Rubinius **during** that quarter.

E.g. after July 1, 2011, we'll print and ship a sticker to everyone who
committed between April 1 and June 30. Each quarter's sticker has the year /
quarter in the corner. Keep committing every quarter and you'll keep
collecting the merit badge stickers.

## One More Thing &mdash; I'm Committed* Sticker

Rubinius is obviously older than the new Rubinius Rewards program. To backfill
for all the contributions people have made over the years up until, we have a
*super duper limited edition never to be made again* sticker... the asterisk.

## Get in Touch

If you're a past committer, [email us](mailto:community@rubini.us) your
mailing address get your special merit sticker. If you're a new committer,
we'll try to take note and reach out to you. If you don't hear from us,
don't be afraid to contact us with your mailing address.
