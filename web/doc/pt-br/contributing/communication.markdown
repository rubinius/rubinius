The Rubinius team appreciates and prizes your contributions. Since Rubinius is
a large and sometimes complex project, communication can be a challenge at
times. We rely heavily on IRC, however, there are other communication channels
as well. Below is a list of places we can be reached:

* IRC: `#rubinius` on irc.freenode.net
* Twitter: [twitter.com/rubinius](http://twitter.com/rubinius)
* Mailing List: [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/rubinius-dev)
