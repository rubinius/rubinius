Building virtual machines in general and programming language implementations
in particular requires some knowledge. Rubinius' goal is to lower the barrier
by keeping as much as possible in Ruby but to hack on the garbage collector you
have to understand what's going on behind the curtains.

This page contains references to books, online lectures, blog posts and any
other publications you may find useful for working on Rubinius.

NOTE that some of these links refer to outdated information about Rubinius.
