  * [GNU Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
  * [MRI Ruby 1.8.7+](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) If your system does not have
    Ruby 1.8.7 installed, consider using [RVM](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
    to install it.
  * [Rubygems](http://www.rubygems.org/)

XCode Tools and Utilities. Once installed, you can enable developer mode crash
reporting at: /Developer/Applications/Utilities/CrashReporterPrefs.app

### FreeBSD

Rubinius has a port in FreeBSD ports tree. It's called `lang/rubinius`. You
can find information about this port on [FreshPorts](http://www.freshports.org/lang/rubinius/). Once being
installed the port installs all the dependencies automagically.
