### Releases

The Rubinius team regularly releases versions of the software. The releases
are primarily source code releases. That means that the version number and
release date are set, and a repository tag is created to demarcate the
release.

The Rubinius team also creates a binary installer for Apple OS X and, when it
is supported, for Microsoft Windows. We do not generally create packages for
other operating systems but we gladly assist package authors to do so. There
are presently Rubinius packages for a variety of Linux and Unix operating
systems.

### Current Release

The current release of Rubinius is always listed on the far right of the
navigation menu at the top of the screen.
