# Channel is a FIFO, thread-aware value passing class that can hold any number
# of objects similar to Queue.  Use #send to add objects to the channel and
# #receive to remove objects from the channel.
#
# If Channel#receive is called on an empty channel, the VM puts the current
# Thread (t1) to sleep.  At some future time, when Channel#send is called on
# that same thread, the VM wakes up t1 and the value passed to #send is
# returned.  This allows us to implement all manner of Thread semantics, such
# as Mutex.
#
# Channel is used heavily by Scheduler, to allow ruby code to interact with
# the outside world in a thread aware manner.
