# Method objects are essentially detached, freely passed-around methods. The
# Method is a copy of the method on the object at the time of extraction, so
# if the method itself is changed, overridden, aliased or removed from the
# object, the Method object still contains the old functionality. In addition,
# the call itself is not in any way stored so it will reflect the state of the
# object at the time of calling.
#
# Methods are normally bound to a particular object but it is possible to use
# Method#unbind to create an UnboundMethod object for the purpose of
# re-binding to a different object.

# can be sent #unbind to detach it from its current object and return an
# UnboundMethod instead. Secondly, they can be directly created by calling
# Module#instance_method with the desired method's name.

# The UnboundMethod is a copy of the method as it existed at the time of
# creation. Any subsequent changes to the original will not affect any
