##
# Objects of class Binding encapsulate the execution context at some
# particular place in the code and retain this context for future use. The
# variables, methods, value of self, and possibly an iterator block that can
# be accessed in this context are all retained. Binding objects can be created
# using Kernel#binding, and are made available to the callback of
# Kernel#set_trace_func.
#
# These binding objects can be passed as the second argument of the
# Kernel#eval method, establishing an environment for the evaluation.

#   k1 = Demo.new(99)
#   b1 = k1.getBinding

#   eval("@secret", b1)   #=> 99
#   eval("@secret", b2)   #=> -3
#   eval("@secret")       #=> nil

# Binding objects have no class-specific methods.
