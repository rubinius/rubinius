##
# Classes in Ruby are first-class objects, each is an instance of
# class Class.
#
# When a new class is created (typically using <tt>class Name; ... end</tt>),
# an object of type Class is created and assigned to a global constant (Name
# in this case). When <tt>Name.new</tt> is called to create a new object, the
# new method in Class is run by default.
#
# This can be demonstrated by overriding new in Class:
#
#   class Class
#     alias old_new new
#     def new(*args)
#       puts "Creating a new #{self.name}"
#       old_new(*args)
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Name
#   end
#
#   n = Name.new
#
# *produces:*
#
#   Creating a new Name
#
# Classes, modules, and objects are interrelated. In the diagram that follows,
# the vertical arrows represent inheritance, and the parentheses meta-classes.
# All singleton classes are instances of the class Class.
