  # InternalBuffer provides a sliding window into a region of bytes.
  # The buffer is filled to the +used+ indicator, which is
  # always less than or equal to +total+. As bytes are taken
  # from the buffer, the +start+ indicator is incremented by
  # the number of bytes taken. Once +start+ == +used+, the
  # buffer is +empty?+ and needs to be refilled.
  #
  # This description should be independent of the "direction"
  # in which the buffer is used. As a read buffer, +fill_from+
  # appends at +used+, but not exceeding +total+. When +used+
  # equals total, no additional bytes will be filled until the
  # buffer is emptied.
  #
  # As a write buffer, +empty_to+ removes bytes from +start+ up
  # to +used+. When +start+ equals +used+, no additional bytes
  # will be emptied until the buffer is filled.
  #
  # IO presents a stream of input. Buffer presents buckets of
  # input. IO's task is to chain the buckets so the user sees
  # a stream. IO explicitly requests that the buffer be filled
  # (on input) and then determines how much of the input to take
  # (e.g. by looking for a separator or collecting a certain
  # number of bytes). Buffer decides whether or not to go to the
  # source for more data or just present what is already in the
  # buffer.
