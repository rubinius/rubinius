1. What is Rubinius

Rubinius is an implementation of the Ruby programming language. Rubinius
includes a bytecode virtual machine, parser, bytecode compiler, garbage
collector, JIT native machine code compiler, and Ruby core and standard
libraries.

Rubinius currently is compatible with Ruby version 1.8.7. Support for Ruby
version 1.9.2 is coming soon.


2. License

Rubinius uses the BSD license. See LICENSE for details.


3. Installing Rubinius

Rubinius runs on Mac OS X and many Unix/Linux operating systems. Support for
Microsoft Windows is coming soon.

For more information about building and running Rubinius, run 'rake docs'.

To install Rubinius, use the following steps:

  1. Ensure you have MRI 1.8.7+, rubygems, rake, and git installed
  2. git clone git://github.com/evanphx/rubinius.git
  3. cd rubinius
  4. ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir
  5. rake install

When the install process finishes, follow the directions to add the Rubinius
executable (bin) directory to you PATH.

After installing Rubinius, you can access the built-in documentation at any
time by running 'rbx docs'.

4. Version 1.1

Rubinius has been under development as a public open-source project since
November 2006. Rubinius development is sponsored by Engine Yard, Inc. and
assisted by the generous work of over 100 contributors.

At version 1.1, Rubinius is significantly feature-complete. It is expected
that your Ruby code will run correctly. Additionally, many MRI C extensions
are expected to work, as long as they do not depend on MRI-specific object
internals or the MRI interpreter internals.

With the JIT, Rubinius performance is quite good, sometimes faster than MRI
and sometimes slower. Rubinius generally executes Ruby code very fast as
compared to MRI. However, since the majority of the Ruby core library is also
implemented in Ruby rather than C as it is in MRI, code that depends heavily
on Array, Hash, String, etc. may run slower in Rubinius right now. As the JIT
improves, overall performance of your code under Rubinius will improve.


5. Goals

* Thread safety. Rubinius intends to be thread-safe so you could embed more
  than one interpreter in a single application.

* Clean, readable code that is easy for users to understand and extend.

* Reliable, rock-solid code. Valgrind is used to help verify correctness.

* Bring modern research in virtual machines, garbage collectors, and compilers
  to the Ruby programming language.
