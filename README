1. What is Rubinius

Rubinius is an implementation of the Ruby programming language.

Rubinius includes a bytecode virtual machine, parser, bytecode compiler,
garbage collector, and just-in-time (JIT) native machine code compiler. The
Ruby core library is written almost entirely in Ruby. Rubinius provides the
same standard libraries as Matz's Ruby implementation (MRI). Rubinius also
provides C-API compatibility for native C extensions.

Rubinius currently is compatible with Ruby version 1.8.7. Full support for Ruby
version 1.9.3 is in progress.

Rubinius runs on Mac OS X and many Unix/Linux operating systems. Support for
Microsoft Windows is coming soon.

Most popular Ruby applications, like Rails, run on Rubinius.
