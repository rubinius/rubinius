= Installation guide for Rubinius as of 10/2007

If you are having trouble with installation, the #rubinius IRC channel on
irc://irc.freenode.net will help.


== Getting the software and required libraries

There are a few things that you need in order to be able to build and run
Rubinius.  Once you have installed the general requirements, install the Gems
needed and then any platform-specific requirements.


=== General requirements

* "GCC version 4.x":http://gcc.gnu.org/
* "GNU Bison":http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
* "gmake (GNU Make)":http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/
* "pkg-config (configuration tool)":http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/
* "libtool version >= 1.5":http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
* "Ruby version >= 1.8.4 (the Ruby language)":http://www.ruby-lang.org/
* "RubyGems (Ruby package manager)":http://www.rubygems.org/
* "Git (source control used by rubinius)":http://git.or.cz/
* "zip and unzip commands (archiving)":http://www.info-zip.org

Each package may have requirements of its own, of course.

If you want to avoid overriding your existing environment, you may want to
install everything under its own prefix (such as /usr/local) and to name
programs so they don't collide with your existing installation (such as naming
gmake 'gmake').  You can then adjust your PATH environment variable as needed
for rubinius development.


=== Requirements through RubyGems

* rake

Rake may be obtained with the gem install command. See `gem help` and
http://www.rubygems.org for more information.


=== System-dependent requirements


==== FreeBSD, OpenBSD

* "libexecinfo (backtrace utilities)":http://www.freshports.org/devel/libexecinfo


== Rubinius itself

You need to check Rubinius out through Git (which we just installed). The
invocation looks like this:

  git clone http://git.rubini.us/code rubinius

For more information on rubinius' best practices for git, see "using
git":http://rubinius.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5089/using-git


== Compiling Rubinius

Once you have all the prerequisites installed, building rubinius is as simple
as:

  cd /path/to/rubinius
  rake build

This will give you a binary, @./shotgun/rubinius@ which can then be invoked to
run scripts. If your system compiler is not GCC 4.x, you can set the CC environment variable:

  CC=/path/to/gcc rake build

If you want a development version (no optimisations, extra debug info), set the DEV environment variable:

  DEV=1 rake build


== Installing Rubinius

To install @rbx@ as a shortcut for @./shotgun/rubinius@:

  make install


== Troubleshooting and platform-specific notes

Right now, the very best thing to do is to join the #rubinius IRC channel on
irc://irc.freenode.net.  The forums here are an alternative method though the
response is probably not going to be as swift. We will try to collect tips
here, too.


=== 64-bit platforms

Currently mostly works on amd64 and Opteron. Other 64-bit platforms have not
been tested.


=== Mac OS X with Fink

See http://42squared.com/posts/how_to_install_rubinius_on_mac_os_x

If you are getting an error like this one:

  glibtool: link: cannot build libtool library `librubinius.la' from non-libtool objects: ...

This is probably because you are using an old glibtool (1.3.5 or similar) that
came with Fink.  This is the case when `which glibtool` returns
/sw/bin/glibtool. You want to use /usr/bin/glibtool (1.5) instead.  If you are
radical you can just `sudo rm /sw/bin/glibtool` to fix this mess.


=== Ubuntu

For the build to succeed you will need these packages:

* libglib2.0-dev
* zlib1g-dev
