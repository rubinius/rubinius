4. Quantifier

  greedy

    ?       1 or 0 times
    *       0 or more times
    +       1 or more times
    {n,m}   at least n but not more than m times
    {n,}    at least n times
    {,n}    at least 0 but not more than n times ({0,n})
    {n}     n times

  reluctant

    ??      1 or 0 times
    *?      0 or more times
    +?      1 or more times
    {n,m}?  at least n but not more than m times  
    {n,}?   at least n times
    {,n}?   at least 0 but not more than n times (== {0,n}?)

  possessive (greedy and does not backtrack after repeated)

    ?+      1 or 0 times
    *+      0 or more times
    ++      1 or more times

    ({n,m}+, {n,}+, {n}+ are possessive op. in ONIG_SYNTAX_JAVA only)

    ex. /a*+/ === /(?>a*)/


5. Anchors

  ^       beginning of the line
  $       end of the line
  \b      word boundary
  \B      not word boundary
  \A      beginning of string
  \Z      end of string, or before newline at the end
  \z      end of string
  \G      matching start position 


6. Character class

  ^...    negative class (lowest precedence operator)
  x-y     range from x to y
  [...]   set (character class in character class)
  ..&&..  intersection (low precedence at the next of ^)
          
    ex. [a-w&&[^c-g]z] ==> ([a-w] AND ([^c-g] OR z)) ==> [abh-w]

  * If you want to use '[', '-', ']' as a normal character
    in a character class, you should escape these characters by '\'.


  POSIX bracket ([:xxxxx:], negate [:^xxxxx:])

    Not Unicode Case:

      alnum    alphabet or digit char
      alpha    alphabet
      ascii    code value: [0 - 127]
      blank    \t, \x20
      cntrl
      digit    0-9
      graph    include all of multibyte encoded characters
      lower
      print    include all of multibyte encoded characters
      punct
      space    \t, \n, \v, \f, \r, \x20
      upper
      xdigit   0-9, a-f, A-F
      word     alphanumeric, "_" and multibyte characters


    Unicode Case:

      alnum    Letter | Mark | Decimal_Number
      alpha    Letter | Mark
      ascii    0000 - 007F
      blank    Space_Separator | 0009
      cntrl    Control | Format | Unassigned | Private_Use | Surrogate

               (0-9, a-f, A-F)
      word     Letter | Mark | Decimal_Number | Connector_Punctuation



7. Extended groups

  (?#...)            comment

  (?imx-imx)         option on/off
                         i: ignore case
                         m: multi-line (dot(.) match newline)
                         x: extended form
  (?imx-imx:subexp)  option on/off for subexp

  (?:subexp)         not captured group
  (subexp)           captured group

  (?=subexp)         look-ahead
  (?!subexp)         negative look-ahead
  (?<=subexp)        look-behind
  (?<!subexp)        negative look-behind

                     Subexp of look-behind must be fixed character length.
                     But different character length is allowed in top level
                     alternatives only.
                     ex. (?<=a|bc) is OK. (?<=aaa(?:b|cd)) is not allowed.

                     In negative-look-behind, captured group isn't allowed, 
                     but shy group(?:) is allowed.

  (?>subexp)         atomic group
                     don't backtrack in subexp.

  (?<name>subexp), (?'name'subexp)
                     define named group
                     (All characters of the name must be a word character.)

                     Not only a name but a number is assigned like a captured
                     group.

                     Assigning the same name as two or more subexps is allowed.
                     In this case, a subexp call can not be performed although
                     the back reference is possible.


8. Back reference

  \n          back reference by group number (n >= 1)
  \k<n>       back reference by group number (n >= 1)
  \k'n'       back reference by group number (n >= 1)
  \k<-n>      back reference by relative group number (n >= 1)
  \k'-n'      back reference by relative group number (n >= 1)
  \k<name>    back reference by group name
  \k'name'    back reference by group name

  In the back reference by the multiplex definition name,
  a subexp with a large number is referred to preferentially.
  (When not matched, a group of the small number is referred to.)

  * Back reference by group number is forbidden if named group is defined 
    in the pattern and ONIG_OPTION_CAPTURE_GROUP is not setted.


  back reference with nest level

    level: 0, 1, 2, ...

    \k<n+level>     (n >= 1)
    \k<n-level>     (n >= 1)
    \k'n+level'     (n >= 1)
    \k'n-level'     (n >= 1)

    \k<name+level>
    \k<name-level>
    \k'name+level'
    \k'name-level'

    Destinate relative nest level from back reference position.    

    ex 1.

      /\A(?<a>|.|(?:(?<b>.)\g<a>\k<b+0>))\z/.match("reer")

    ex 2.

      r = Regexp.compile(<<'__REGEXP__'.strip, Regexp::EXTENDED)
      (?<element> \g<stag> \g<content>* \g<etag> ){0}
      (?<stag> < \g<name> \s* > ){0}
      (?<name> [a-zA-Z_:]+ ){0}
      (?<content> [^<&]+ (\g<element> | [^<&]+)* ){0}
      (?<etag> </ \k<name+1> >){0}
      \g<element>
      __REGEXP__

      p r.match('<foo>f<bar>bbb</bar>f</foo>').captures



9. Subexp call ("Tanaka Akira special")

  \g<name>    call by group name
  \g'name'    call by group name
  \g<n>       call by group number (n >= 1)
  \g'n'       call by group number (n >= 1)
  \g<-n>      call by relative group number (n >= 1)
  \g'-n'      call by relative group number (n >= 1)

  * left-most recursive call is not allowed.
     ex. (?<name>a|\g<name>b)   => error
         (?<name>a|b\g<name>c)  => OK

  * Call by group number is forbidden if named group is defined in the pattern
    and ONIG_OPTION_CAPTURE_GROUP is not setted.

  * If the option status of called group is different from calling position
    then the group's option is effective.

    ex. (?-i:\g<name>)(?i:(?<name>a)){0}  match to "A"


10. Captured group

  Behavior of the no-named group (...) changes with the following conditions.
  (But named group is not changed.)

  case 1. /.../     (named group is not used, no option)

     (...) is treated as a captured group.

  case 2. /.../g    (named group is not used, 'g' option)

     (...) is treated as a no-captured group (?:...).

  case 3. /..(?<name>..)../   (named group is used, no option)

     (...) is treated as a no-captured group (?:...).
     numbered-backref/call is not allowed.

  case 4. /..(?<name>..)../G  (named group is used, 'G' option)

     (...) is treated as a captured group.
     numbered-backref/call is allowed.

  where
    g: ONIG_OPTION_DONT_CAPTURE_GROUP
    G: ONIG_OPTION_CAPTURE_GROUP

  ('g' and 'G' options are argued in ruby-dev ML)



-----------------------------
A-1. Syntax depend options

   + ONIG_SYNTAX_RUBY
     (?m): dot(.) match newline

   + ONIG_SYNTAX_PERL and ONIG_SYNTAX_JAVA
     (?s): dot(.) match newline
     (?m): ^ match after newline, $ match before newline


A-2. Original extensions

   + hexadecimal digit char type  \h, \H
   + named group                  (?<name>...), (?'name'...)
   + named backref                \k<name>
   + subexp call                  \g<name>, \g<group-num>


A-3. Lacked features compare with perl 5.8.0

   + \N{name}
   + \l,\u,\L,\U, \X, \C
   + (?{code})
   + (??{code})
   + (?(condition)yes-pat|no-pat)

   * \Q...\E
     This is effective on ONIG_SYNTAX_PERL and ONIG_SYNTAX_JAVA.


A-4. Differences with Japanized GNU regex(version 0.12) of Ruby 1.8

   + add character property (\p{property}, \P{property})
   + add hexadecimal digit char type (\h, \H)
   + add look-behind
     (?<=fixed-char-length-pattern), (?<!fixed-char-length-pattern)
   + add possessive quantifier. ?+, *+, ++
   + add operations in character class. [], &&
     ('[' must be escaped as an usual char in character class.)
   + add named group and subexp call.
   + octal or hexadecimal number sequence can be treated as 
     a multibyte code char in character class if multibyte encoding
     is specified.
     (ex. [\xa1\xa2], [\xa1\xa7-\xa4\xa1])
   + allow the range of single byte char and multibyte char in character
     class.
     ex. /[a-<<any EUC-JP character>>]/ in EUC-JP encoding.
   + effect range of isolated option is to next ')'.
     ex. (?:(?i)a|b) is interpreted as (?:(?i:a|b)), not (?:(?i:a)|b).
   + isolated option is not transparent to previous pattern.
     ex. a(?i)* is a syntax error pattern.
   + allowed incompleted left brace as an usual string.
     ex. /{/, /({)/, /a{2,3/ etc...
   + negative POSIX bracket [:^xxxx:] is supported.
   + POSIX bracket [:ascii:] is added.
   + repeat of look-ahead is not allowed.
     ex. /(?=a)*/, /(?!b){5}/
   + Ignore case option is effective to numbered character.
     ex. /\x61/i =~ "A"
   + In the range quantifier, the number of the minimum is omissible.
     /a{,n}/ == /a{0,n}/
     The simultanious abbreviation of the number of times of the minimum
     and the maximum is not allowed. (/a{,}/)
   + /a{n}?/ is not a non-greedy operator.
     /a{n}?/ == /(?:a{n})?/
   + invalid back reference is checked and cause error.
     /\1/, /(a)\2/
   + Zero-length match in infinite repeat stops the repeat,
     then changes of the capture group status are checked as stop condition.
     /(?:()|())*\1\2/ =~ ""
     /(?:\1a|())*/ =~ "a"


A-5. Disabled functions by default syntax

   + capture history

     (?@...) and (?@<name>...)

     ex. /(?@a)*/.match("aaa") ==> [<0-1>, <1-2>, <2-3>]

     see sample/listcap.c file.


A-6. Problems

   + Invalid encoding byte sequence is not checked.

     ex. UTF-8

     * Invalid first byte is treated as a character.
       /./u =~ "\xa3"

     * Incomplete byte sequence is not checked.
       /\w+/ =~ "a\xf3\x8ec"

// END
