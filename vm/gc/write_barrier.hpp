  /**
   * A write barrier keeps track of objects in the mature generation that hold
   * references to objects in the young generation.
   *
   * A write barrier allows the young generation to be garbage collected without
   * inspecting every object in the older generations (mature and large object)
   * to determine if a young object is still referenced (i.e. alive).  As most
   * cross-generation references are from young objects to mature ones,
   * remembering the rarer instances when a mature object has a reference to a
   * young object results in a smaller set of objects to scan when collecting
   * the young generation.
   *
   * The set of locations containing pointers to young generation objects is
   * known as the remembered set. At every store, the system must ensure that
   * the updated location is added to the remembered set if the store creates
   * a reference from an older generation object to a young generation object.
   *
   * The remembered set is cleared on each collection of the young generation
   * (via #swap_remember_set), as scanning objects that were in the remember set
   * as part of the young collection will re-remember mature objects that
   * continue to hold a reference to (still) young objects.
   *
   * Additionally, when a full collection is performed, any mature objects
   * that die are removed from the remember set (via #unremember_object and
   * #unremember_objects), ensuring they do not keep alive young objects they
   * reference.
