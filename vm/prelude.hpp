 *  stored directly in the pointer value (and distinguished by the
 *  tag, see oop.hpp) but provided we do not attempt to dereference
 *  it, we can ALSO define a class and treat the pointer values as
 *  if they were real pointers to real objects of that class where
 *  typing is concerned. In the "instance methods", the this pointer
 *  is still the correct pointer value and can thus be used for the
 *  calculations needed.
