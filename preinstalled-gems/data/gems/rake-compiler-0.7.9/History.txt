=== 0.7.9 / 2011-06-08

* Enhancements:
  * Consistently use RubyGems features available since version 1.3.2 and avoid
    deprecation warnings with Rake > 0.8.7.

* Bugfixes:
  * Use correct platform in fake.rb. Pull #39 [kou]

  * ExtensionTask now support config_includes to load additional directories.
    [jfinkhaeuser]

    Rake::ExtensionTask.new("myext", GEM_SPEC) do |ext|
      ext.config_includes << File.expand_path("my", "custom", "dir")
    end

* Bugfixes:
  * Warn if compiled files exists in extension's source directory. Closes GH-35
  * Workaround issue with WINE using proper build option. Closes GH-37
  * Use FileUtils#install instead of cp. Closes GH-33 [Eric Wong]

=== 0.7.7 / 2011-04-04

* Bugfixes:
  * Use Winsock2 as default to match Ruby 1.9.2 library linking.

=== 0.7.6 / 2011-02-04

* Bugfixes:
  * Prefer Psych over Syck for YAML parsing on Ruby 1.9.2. [tenderlove]

=== 0.7.5 / 2010-11-25

* Enhancements:
  * Promoted stable version for cross-compilation to 1.8.6-p398. Closes GH-19

* Bugfixes:
  * Generate a fake.rb compatible with Ruby 1.9.2. Closes GH-25
  * fake.rb will not try to mimic Ruby's own fake to the letter. Closes GH-28
  * Expand symlinks for tmp_dir. Closes GH-24
  * Silence make output during rake-compiler invocation.
  * Usage of Gem.ruby instead of RbConfig ruby_install_name
    This solve issues with ruby vs. ruby.exe and jruby.exe

* Experimental:
  * Allow setting of HOST during cross-compilation. This enable usage
    of mingw-w64 compiler and not the first one found in the PATH.

      rake-compiler cross-ruby VERSION=1.9.2-p0 HOST=i686-w64-mingw32
      rake-compiler cross-ruby HOST=i386-mingw32 (OSX mingw32 port)
      rake-compiler cross-ruby HOST=i586-pc-mingw32 (Debian/Ubuntu mingw32)

=== 0.7.1 / 2010-08-07

* Bugfixes:
  * Update gem files to make "gem install -t" works. Closes GH-14
  * Update mocks to work under 1.8.7. Closes GH-15 [luisparravicini]
  * Do not allow cross-ruby be executed under Windows. Closes GH-22

* Experimental:
  * Allow JRuby to compile C extensions [timfel].
    It is now possible compile C extensions using latest JRuby. Offered
    in experimental mode since JRuby cext hasn't been officially released.

=== 0.7.0 / 2009-12-08

* Enhancements
  * Allow generation of JRuby extensions. Thanks to Alex Coles (myabc) for the
    contribution.
    This will allow, with proper JDK tools, cross compilation of JRuby gems
    from MRI.

      Rake::JavaExtensionTask.new('my_java_extension', GEM_SPEC) do |ext|
        # most of ExtensionTask options can be used
        # plus, java_compiling:
        ext.java_compiling do |gem_spec|
          gem_spec.post_install_message = "This is a native JRuby gem!"
        end
      end

    Please note that cross-compiling JRuby gems requires either JRUBY_HOME or
    JRUBY_PARENT_CLASSPATH environment variables being properly set.

  * Allow alteration of the Gem Specification when cross compiling. Closes GH-3
    This is useful to indicate a custom requirement message, like DLLs
    installation or similar.

      Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension', GEM_SPEC) do |ext|
        ext.cross_compile = true
        # ...
        ext.cross_compiling do |gem_spec|
          gem_spec.post_install_message = "You've installed a binary version of this gem"
        end
      end

* Bugfixes
  * Detect GNU make independently of distribution based naming.
    Thanks to flori for patches.
  * Usage of #dup to duplicate gemspec instead of YAML dumping.
  * No longer support Ruby older than 1.8.6
  * No longer support RubyGems older than 1.3.5
  * Force definition of binary directory and executables. Closes GH-11
  * Workaround path with spaces issues using relative paths. Closes GH-6
  * Removed gemspec, GitHub gems no more

* Known issues
  * Usage of rake-compiler under projects with Jeweler requires some tweaks
    Please read issue GH-73 for Jeweler:
    http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/issues#issue/73

    For a workaround, look here:

=== 0.6.0 / 2009-07-25

* Enhancements
  * Implemented 'fat-binaries' generation for cross compiling
    (for now). Thanks to Aaron Patterson for the suggestion and
    original idea.

      rake cross native gem RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8.6:1.9.1

    Will package extensions for 1.8 and 1.9 versions of Ruby.
  * Can now cross compile extensions for 1.9 using 1.8.x as base.
    Be warned: works from 1.8 to 1.9, but not if your default ruby is 1.9

      rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.9.1

  * Allow simultaneous versions of Ruby to compile extensions.
    This change allow 1.8.x compiles co-exist with 1.9.x ones
    and don't override each other.

    Please perform <tt>rake clobber</tt> prior compiling again.
  * Allow optional source file URL for cross-compile tasks.
    (Thanks to deepj for the patches)

      rake-compiler cross-ruby VERSION=1.9.1-p0 SOURCE=http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-p0.tar.bz2

* Bugfixes
  * Removed strict versioning for gems since it clash with fat binaries.
    From now on, if your gem only targets a specific version of Ruby, please
    indicate it in the Gem::Specification (<tt>required_ruby_version</tt>)

=== 0.5.0 / 2009-04-25

* Enhancements
  * Allow generation of multiple gems for Windows (EXPERIMENTAL)
    This allows build gems for both VC6 and MinGW builts of Ruby
    (Thanks to Jonathan Stott for the suggestion)

      Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension', GEM_SPEC) do |ext|
        ext.cross_compile = true
        ext.cross_platform = ['i386-mswin32', 'i386-mingw32']
      end

=== 0.4.1 / 2009-04-09

* Enhancements
  * Target specific versions of Ruby when generating binaries.
    This avoids installing a 1.8.x binary gem in 1.9.x and viceversa.
    (Thanks to Aaron Patterson for the patches)

* Bugfixes
  * No longer raises error if rake-compiler configuration is missing.
    Not all users of a project would have it installed.
    (Thanks to Aaron Patterson for the patch)

=== 0.4.0 / 2009-04-03

* Enhancements
  * Bended the convention for extension folder.
    Defining <tt>ext_dir</tt> for custom extension location.

      Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension') do |ext|
        ext.ext_dir = 'custom/location'         # look into custom/location
      end                                       # instead of ext/my_extension

  * Better detection of mingw target across Linux/OSX.
    Exposed it as Rake::ExtensionCompiler
  * Display list of available tasks when calling rake-compiler script
  * Track Ruby full versioning (x.y.z).
    This will help the compilation of extensions targetting 1.8.6/7 and 1.9.1

* Bugfixes
  * Better output of Rake development tasks (Thanks to Luis Parravicini).
  * Proper usage of Gem::Platform for native gems (Thanks to Dirkjan Bussink).
  * Don't use autoload for YAML (present problems with Ruby 1.9.1).

=== 0.3.1 / 2009-01-09

* Enhancements
  * Download cross-ruby source code using HTTP instead of FTP.
  * Disabled Tcl/Tk extension building on cross-ruby (helps with 1.9).

* Bugfixes
  * Workaround bug introduced by lack of Gem::Specification cloning. Fixes DM LH #757.
  * Use proper binary extension on OSX (reported by Dirkjan Bussink).
  * Ensure lib/binary task is defined prior clear of requisites.

=== 0.3.0 / 2008-12-07

* New features
  * Let you specify the Ruby version used for cross compilation instead
    of default one.

      rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8

* Enhancements
  * Properly update rake-compiler configuration when new version is installed.
  * Automated release process to RubyForge, yay!

* Bugfixes
  * Corrected documentation to reflect the available options

=== 0.2.1 / 2008-11-30

* New features

  * Allow cross compilation (cross compile) using mingw32 on Linux or OSX.
  * Allow packaging of gems for Windows on Linux or OSX.

* Enhancements

  * Made generation of extensions safe and target folders per-platform

* Bugfixes

  * Ensure binaries for the specific platform are copied before packaging.
