The benchmark/rbs benchmarks are imported and refactored from the Ruby
Benchmark Suite project at:

  http://github.com/acangiano/ruby-benchmark-suite/tree/master

The benchmarks are organized into layers. These are described below from the
inside out.

*   The benchmark file itself is very simple. It sets up the code needed to
    run the benchmark and the calls Bench.run with an array of inputs and a
    block to do the work.

        def worker(n)
          # do something with n
        end

        Bench.run [5, 10, 15] do |n|
          worker n
        end

    This keeps the benchmark file focused on the benchmark code itself and not
    all the extraneous driver, timing, and reporting code.

*   The Bench runner class provides the time recording, statistical
    calculations and reporting. The runner can be invoked directly using the
    Ruby implementation of choice. It outputs details about the run to YAML
    files, which can be post processed in many ways. Each run records an array
    of times kept in the order they were run, the inputs passed to Bench.run,
    the max, min, median, mean, and standard deviation for each set of
    iterations. The Bench class is defined in benchmark/utils/bench.rb.

    The benchmark file (above) and this Bench runner class are the most
    complex code that will be run by the implementation being benchmarked.
    This is an important aspect of the layered approach. An implementation
    should not need more than classes, methods, instance variables, and a
    couple system functions like Time.now and File.basename (this could be
    removed) to run the benchmarks.

*   Above the Bench runner, there is a monitor that invoke the runner and
    aborts it if the run time exceeds a limit. This layer is entirely optional
    and likely platform specific (especially on Windows). The current monitor
    is in benchmark/utils/monitor.rb and relies on a shell script to abort a
    process that runs longer than a certain number of seconds.

    On Windows, there are several options including (possibly) running under
    a cygwin Bash shell, writing a small C/C++ multithreaded program to system
    and abort a process (this could be a portable program and used an all
    platforms), using Windows scripting utilities (possibly).

    Like the Bench runner, the monitor can be invoked directly.

*   At the top are several Rake tasks that simplify running a whole directory
    of benchmarks, the whole RBS suite, or just one benchmark file. These
    tasks are illustrated below:

        rake bench  # Runs all the RBS benchmarks

        rake bench:file FILE=benchmark/rbs/core-features/bm_app_fib.rb

        rake bench:dir DIR=benchmark/rbs/micro-benchmarks

    The rake tasks format the reporting filename with date and time. The files
    are currently stored in benchmark/results/rbs as the rbs/**/bm_*.rb files
    are the only ones using this system. However, the reporting can be
    generalized to the other benchmark directories when/if those benchmarks
    are converted.

    The rake tasks can customized by setting the following environment
    variables:

        VM         - The Ruby implementation to execute the Bench runner.

        MONITOR    - The monitor program that will abort the Bench runner
        process if it runs for longer than TIMEOUT seconds

        RUNNER     - The Bench runner script

        TIMEOUT    - The number of seconds before the Bench runner process
        will be aborted. This should be limit of the expected time for
        Bench.run to invoke the block ITERATIONS times for each item in the
        inputs array.

        ITERATIONS - The number of times Bench.run invokes the block for each
        item in the inputs array.

    There is also a task for converting several YAML results files into a
    convenient CVS file. The YAML files are processed for the desired field in
    each benchmark result. The field defaults to the "min" time.

    To convert all the .yaml files in benchmark/results/rbs:

        rake bench:to_csv

    The task can be customized by setting the following environment variables:

      RESULTS - The directory to search for the .yaml files and in which to
      place the .csv file.

      FIELD   - The item to extract for each benchmark in each results file.
      This defaults to "min".
