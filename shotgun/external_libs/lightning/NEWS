NEWS FROM VERSION 1.2 TO 1.3

o   Initial support for x86-64 back-end (mostly untested).

o   lightning is more strict on casts from integer to pointer.
    Be sure to use the _p variants when your immediates are
    of pointer type.  This was done to ease 64-bit cleanliness
    tests.

o   Many bug fixes.

o   JIT_FPRET is used as JIT_RET to move return values.
    jit_retval_[fd] is used to retrieve return values.

o   jit_pushr/jit_popr are deprecated, you need to #define
    JIT_NEED_PUSH_POP prior to including lightning.h if you
    want to use them.

o   Support for stack-allocated variables.  Because of this,
    backends defining JIT_FP should now rename it to JIT_AP.
    JIT_FP is now a user-visible register used in ldxi/ldxr
    to access stack-allocated variables.
