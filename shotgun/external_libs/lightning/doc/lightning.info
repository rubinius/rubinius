1 Introduction to GNU lightning
*******************************

Dynamic code generation is the generation of machine code at runtime.
It is typically used to strip a layer of interpretation by allowing
compilation to occur at runtime.  One of the most well-known
applications of dynamic code generation is perhaps that of interpreters
that compile source code to an intermediate bytecode form, which is
then recompiled to machine code at run-time: this approach effectively
combines the portability of bytecode representations with the speed of
machine code.  Another common application of dynamic code generation is
in the field of hardware simulators and binary emulators, which can use
the same techniques to translate simulated instructions to the
instructions of the underlying machine.

   Yet other applications come to mind: for example, windowing "bitblt"
operations, matrix manipulations, and network packet filters.  Albeit
very powerful and relatively well known within the compiler community,
dynamic code generation techniques are rarely exploited to their full
potential and, with the exception of the two applications described
above, have remained curiosities because of their portability and
functionality barriers: binary instructions are generated, so programs
using dynamic code generation must be retargeted for each machine; in
addition, coding a run-time code generator is a tedious and error-prone
task more than a difficult one.

   This manual describes the GNU lightning dynamic code generation
library.  GNU lightning provides a portable, fast and easily
retargetable dynamic code generation system.

   To be fast, GNU lightning emits machine code without first creating
intermediate data structures such as RTL representations traditionally
used by optimizing compilers (*note RTL representation: (gcc)RTL
representation.).  GNU lightning translates code directly from a
machine independent interface to that of the underlying architecture.
This makes code generation more efficient, since no intermediate data
structures have to be constructed and consumed.  A collateral benefit
it that GNU lightning consumes little space: other than the memory
needed to store generated instructions and data structures such as
parse trees, the only data structure that client will usually need is
an array of pointers to labels and unresolved jumps, which you can
often allocate directly on the system stack.

   To be portable, GNU lightning abstracts over current architectures'
quirks and unorthogonalities.  The interface that it exposes to is that
of a standardized RISC architecture loosely based on the SPARC and MIPS
chips.  There are a few general-purpose registers (six, not including
those used to receive and pass parameters between subroutines), and
arithmetic operations involve three operands--either three registers or
two registers and an arbitrarily sized immediate value.

   On one hand, this architecture is general enough that it is possible
to generate pretty efficient code even on CISC architectures such as the
Intel x86 or the Motorola 68k families.  On the other hand, it matches
real architectures closely enough that, most of the time, the
compiler's constant folding pass ends up generating code which
assembles machine instructions without further tests.

1.1 Drawbacks
=============

GNU lightning has been useful in practice; however, it does have at
least four drawbacks: it has limited registers, no peephole optimizer,
no instruction scheduler and no symbolic debugger. Of these, the last
is the most critical even though it does not affect the quality of
generated code: the only way to debug code generated at run-time  is to
step through it at the level of host specific machine code.  A decent
knowledge of the underlying instruction set is thus needed to make
sense of the debugger's output.

   The low number of available registers (six) is also an important
limitation.  However, let's take the primary application of dynamic
code generation, that is, bytecode translators.  The underlying virtual
machines tend to have very few general purpose registers (usually 0 to
2) and the translators seldom rely on sophisticated graph-coloring
algorithms to allocate registers to temporary variables.  Rather, these
translators usually obtain performance increases because: a) they
remove indirect jumps, which are usually poorly predicted, and thus
often form a bottleneck, b) they parameterize the generated code and go
through the process of decoding the bytecodes just once.  So, their
usage of registers is rather sparse--in fact, in practice, six
registers were found to be enough for most purposes.

   The lack of a peephole optimizer is most important on machines where
a single instruction can map to multiple native instructions.  For
instance, Intel chips' division instruction hard-codes the dividend to
be in EAX and the quotient and remainder to be output, respectively, in
EAX and EDX: on such chips, GNU lightning does lots of pushing and
popping of EAX and EDX to save those registers that are not used.
Unnecessary stack operations could be removed by looking at whether
preserved registers are destroyed soon.  Unfortunately, the current
implementation of GNU lightning is so fast because it only knows about
the single instruction that is being generated; performing these
optimizations would require a flow analysis pass that would probably
hinder GNU lightning's speed.

   The lack of an instruction scheduler is not very important--pretty
good instruction scheduling can actually be obtained by separating
register writes from register reads.  The only architectures on which a
scheduler would be useful are those on which arithmetic instructions
have two operands; an example is, again, the x86, on which the single
instruction
         subr_i  R0, R1, R2       !Compute R0 = R1 - R2
   is translated to two instruction, of which the second depends on the
result of the first:
         movl    %ebx, %eax       ! Move R1 into R0
         subl    %edx, %eax       ! Subtract R2 from R0

2.1 Configuring and installing GNU lightning
============================================

The first thing to do to use GNU lightning is to configure the program,
picking the set of macros to be used on the host architecture; this
configuration is automatically performed by the `configure' shell
script; to run it, merely type:
          ./configure

   GNU lightning supports cross-compiling in that you can choose a
different set of macros from the one needed on the computer that you
are compiling GNU lightning on.  For example,
          ./configure --host=sparc-sun-linux

will select the SPARC set of runtime assemblers.  You can use
configure's ability to make reasonable assumptions about the vendor and
operating system and simply type
          ./configure --host=i386
          ./configure --host=ppc
          ./configure --host=sparc

   Another option that `configure' accepts is `--enable-assertions',
which enables several consistency checks in the run-time assemblers.
These are not usually needed, so you can decide to simply forget about
it; also remember that these consistency checks tend to slow down your
code generator.

   After you've configured GNU lightning, you don't have to compile it
because it is nothing more than a set of include files.  If you want to
compile the examples, run `make' as usual.  The next important step is:
         make install

   This ends the process of installing GNU lightning.

2.2 GNU lightning's instruction set
===================================

GNU lightning's instruction set was designed by deriving instructions
that closely match those of most existing RISC architectures, or that
can be easily syntesized if absent.  Each instruction is composed of:
   * an operation, like `sub' or `mul'

   * sometimes, an register/immediate flag (`r' or `i')

   * a type identifier or, occasionally, two

   The second and third field are separated by an underscore; thus,
examples of legal mnemonics are `addr_i' (integer add, with three
register operands) and `muli_l' (long integer multiply, with two
register operands and an immediate operand).  Each instruction takes
two or three operands; in most cases, one of them can be an immediate
value instead of a register.

   GNU lightning supports a full range of integer types: operands can
be 1, 2 or 4 bytes long (64-bit architectures might support 8 bytes long
operands), either signed or unsigned.  The types are listed in the
following table together with the C types they represent:

          c          signed char
          uc         unsigned char
          s          short
          us         unsigned short
          i          int
          ui         unsigned int
          l          long
          ul         unsigned long
          f          float
          d          double
          p          void *

   Some of these types may not be distinct: for example, (e.g., `l' is
equivalent to `i' on 32-bit machines, and `p' is substantially
equivalent to `ul').

   There are at least seven integer registers, of which six are
general-purpose, while the last is used to contain the frame pointer
(`FP').  The frame pointer can be used to allocate and access local
variables on the stack, using the `allocai' instruction.

   Of the general-purpose registers, at least three are guaranteed to be
preserved across function calls (`V0', `V1' and `V2') and at least
three are not (`R0', `R1' and `R2').  Six registers are not very much,
but this restriction was forced by the need to target CISC architectures
which, like the x86, are poor of registers; anyway, backends can
specify the actual number of available registers with the macros
`JIT_R_NUM' (for caller-save registers) and `JIT_V_NUM' (for
callee-save registers).

   In addition, there is a special `RET' register which contains the
return value of the current function (_not_ the return value of
callees--use the `retval' instruction for this).  You should always
remember, however, that writing this register could overwrite either a
general-purpose register or an incoming parameter, depending on the
architecture.

   There are at least six floating-point registers, named `FPR0' to
`FPR5'.  These are caller-save and are separate from the integer
registers on all the supported architectures; on Intel architectures,
the register stack is mapped to a flat register file.  As for the
integer registers, the macro `JIT_FPR_NUM' yields the number of
floating-point registers, and the special `FPRET' register contains the
return value of the current function.

   The complete instruction set follows; as you can see, most non-memory
operations only take integers, long integers (either signed or
unsigned) and pointers as operands; this was done in order to reduce
the instruction set, and because most architectures only provide word
and long word operations on registers.  There are instructions that
allow operands to be extended to fit a larger data type, both in a
signed and in an unsigned way.

Binary ALU operations
     These accept three operands; the last one can be an immediate
     value for integer operands, or a register for all operand types.
     `addx' operations must directly follow `addc', and `subx' must
     follow `subc'; otherwise, results are undefined.

          divr     i  ui  l  ul     f  d  O1 = O2 / O3

          andr     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 & O3
          andi     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 & O3
          orr      i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 | O3
          ori      i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 | O3
          xorr     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 ^ O3
          xori     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 ^ O3
          lshr     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 << O3
          lshi     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 << O3
          rshr     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 >> O3(1)
          rshi     i  ui  l  ul           O1 = O2 >> O3(2)

Unary ALU operations
     These accept two operands, both of which must be registers.
          negr     i     l         f  d  O1 = -O2
          notr     i  ui l  ul           O1 = ~O2

Compare instructions
     These accept three operands; again, the last can be an immediate
     value for integer data types.  The last two operands are compared,
     and the first operand is set to either 0 or 1, according to
     whether the given condition was met or not.

     The conditions given below are for the standard behavior of C,
     where the "unordered" comparison result is mapped to false.

          ltr      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = (O2 <  O3)
          lti      i  ui  l  ul  p        O1 = (O2 <  O3)
          ler      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = (O2 <= O3)
          lei      i  ui  l  ul  p        O1 = (O2 <= O3)
          gtr      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = (O2 >  O3)
          gti      i  ui  l  ul  p        O1 = (O2 >  O3)
          ger      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = (O2 >= O3)
          gei      i  ui  l  ul  p        O1 = (O2 >= O3)
          eqr      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = (O2 == O3)
          eqi      i  ui  l  ul  p        O1 = (O2 == O3)

          nei      i  ui  l  ul  p        O1 = (O2 != O3)
          unltr                     f  d  O1 = !(O2 >= O3)
          unler                     f  d  O1 = !(O2 >  O3)
          ungtr                     f  d  O1 = !(O2 <= O3)
          unger                     f  d  O1 = !(O2 <  O3)
          uneqr                     f  d  O1 = !(O2 <  O3) && !(O2 >  O3)
          ltgtr                     f  d  O1 = !(O2 >= O3) || !(O2 <= O3)
          ordr                      f  d  O1 =  (O2 == O2) &&  (O3 == O3)
          unordr                    f  d  O1 =  (O2 != O2) ||  (O3 != O3)

Transfer operations
     These accept two operands; for `ext' both of them must be
     registers, while `mov' accepts an immediate value as the second
     operand.

     Unlike `movr' and `movi', the other instructions are applied
     between operands of different data types, and they need *two* data
     type specifications.  You can use `extr' to convert between
     integer data types, in which case the first must be smaller in size
     than the second; for example `extr_c_ui' is correct while
     `extr_ul_us' is not.  You can also use `extr' to convert an
     integer to a floating point value: the only available possibilities
     are `extr_i_f' and `extr_i_d'.  The other instructions convert a
     floating point value to an integer, so the possible suffixes are
     `_f_i' and `_d_i'.

          movr                      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = O2
          movi                      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = O2
          extr        c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul     f  d  O1 = O2
          roundr                    i                f  d  O1 = round(O2)
          truncr                    i                f  d  O1 = trunc(O2)
          floorr                    i                f  d  O1 = floor(O2)
          ceilr                     i                f  d  O1 = ceil(O2)

     Note that the order of the arguments is _destination first, source
     second_ as for all other GNU lightning instructions, but the order
     of the types is always reversed with respect to that of the
     arguments: _shorter_--source--_first,
     longer_--destination--_second_.  This happens for historical
     reasons.

Network extensions
     These accept two operands, both of which must be registers; these
     two instructions actually perform the same task, yet they are
     assigned to two mnemonics for the sake of convenience and
     completeness.  As usual, the first operand is the destination and
     the second is the source.
          hton       us ui          Host-to-network (big endian) order
          ntoh       us ui          Network-to-host order

Load operations
     `ld' accepts two operands while `ldx' accepts three; in both
     cases, the last can be either a register or an immediate value.
     Values are extended (with or without sign, according to the data
     type specification) to fit a whole register.
          ldr     c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = *O2
          ldi     c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = *O2
          ldxr    c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = *(O2+O3)
          ldxi    c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  O1 = *(O2+O3)

Store operations
     `st' accepts two operands while `stx' accepts three; in both
     cases, the first can be either a register or an immediate value.
     Values are sign-extended to fit a whole register.
          str     c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  *O1 = O2
          sti     c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  *O1 = O2
          stxr    c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  *(O1+O2) = O3
          stxi    c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  *(O1+O2) = O3

Argument management
     These are:
          prepare                   i                f  d
          pusharg     c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d
          getarg      c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d
          arg         c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d
          retval      c  uc  s  us  i  ui  l  ul  p

     Of these, the first two are used by the caller, while the last two
     are used by the callee.  A code snippet that wants to call another
     procedure and has to pass registers must, in order: use the
     `prepare' instruction, giving the number of arguments to be passed
     to the procedure (once for each data type); use `pusharg' to push
     the arguments *in reverse order*; and use `calli' or `finish'
     (explained below) to perform the actual call.

     `arg' and `getarg' are used by the callee.  `arg' is different
     from other instruction in that it does not actually generate any
     code: instead, it is a function which returns a value to be passed
     to `getarg'.(3) You should call `arg' as soon as possible, before
     any function call or, more easily, right after the `prolog' or
     `leaf' instructions (which are treated later).

     `getarg' accepts a register argument and a value returned by
     `arg', and will move that argument to the register, extending it
     (with or without sign, according to the data type specification)
     to fit a whole register.  These instructions are more intimately
     related to the usage of the GNU lightning instruction set in code
     that generates other code, so they will be treated more
     specifically in *Note Generating code at run-time: GNU lightning
     macros.

     Finally, the `retval' instruction fetches the return value of a
     called function in a register.  The `retval' instruction takes a
     register argument and copies the return value of the previously
     called function in that register.  A function should put its own
     return value in the `RET' register before returning.  *Note the
     Fibonacci numbers: Fibonacci, for an example.

     You should observe a few rules when using these macros.  First of
     all, it is not allowed to call functions with more than six
     arguments; this was done to simplify and speed up the
     implementation on architectures that use registers for parameter
     passing.

     You should not nest calls to `prepare', nor call zero-argument
     functions (which do not need a call to `prepare') inside a
     `prepare/calli' or `prepare/finish' block.  Doing this might
     corrupt already pushed arguments.

     You *cannot* pass parameters between subroutines using the six
     general-purpose registers.  This might work only when targeting
     particular architectures.

     On the other hand, it is possible to assume that callee-saved
     registers (`R0' through `R2') are not clobbered by another
     dynamically generated function which does not use them as operands
     in its code and which does not return a value.

Branch instructions
     Like `arg', these also return a value which, in this case, is to
     be used to compile forward branches as explained in *Note
     Fibonacci numbers: Fibonacci.  They accept a pointer to the
     destination of the branch and two operands to be compared; of
     these, the last can be either a register or an immediate.  They
     are:
          bltr      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  if (O2 <  O3) goto O1
          blti      i  ui  l  ul  p        if (O2 <  O3) goto O1
          bler      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  if (O2 <= O3) goto O1
          blei      i  ui  l  ul  p        if (O2 <= O3) goto O1
          bgtr      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  if (O2 >  O3) goto O1
          bgti      i  ui  l  ul  p        if (O2 >  O3) goto O1
          bger      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  if (O2 >= O3) goto O1
          bgei      i  ui  l  ul  p        if (O2 >= O3) goto O1
          beqr      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  if (O2 == O3) goto O1
          beqi      i  ui  l  ul  p        if (O2 == O3) goto O1
          bner      i  ui  l  ul  p  f  d  if (O2 != O3) goto O1
          bnei      i  ui  l  ul  p        if (O2 != O3) goto O1

          bunltr                     f  d  if !(O2 >= O3) goto O1
          bunler                     f  d  if !(O2 >  O3) goto O1
          bungtr                     f  d  if !(O2 <= O3) goto O1
          bunger                     f  d  if !(O2 <  O3) goto O1
          buneqr                     f  d  if !(O2 <  O3) && !(O2 >  O3) goto O1
          bltgtr                     f  d  if !(O2 >= O3) || !(O2 <= O3) goto O1
          bordr                      f  d  if  (O2 == O2) &&  (O3 == O3) goto O1
          bunordr                    f  d  if !(O2 != O2) ||  (O3 != O3) goto O1

          bmsr      i ui l  ul             if O2 &  O3 goto O1
          bmsi      i ui l  ul             if O2 &  O3 goto O1
          bmcr      i ui l  ul             if !(O2 & O3) goto O1
          bmci      i ui l  ul             if !(O2 & O3) goto O1(4)
          boaddr    i ui l  ul             O2 += O3, goto O1 on overflow
          boaddi    i ui l  ul             O2 += O3, goto O1 on overflow
          bosubr    i ui l  ul             O2 -= O3, goto O1 on overflow
          bosubi    i ui l  ul             O2 -= O3, goto O1 on overflow

Jump and return operations
     These accept one argument except `ret' which has none; the
     difference between `finish' and `calli' is that the latter does
     not clean the stack from pushed parameters (if any) and the former
     must *always* follow a `prepare' instruction.
          calli     (not specified)                  function call to O1
          callr     (not specified)                  function call to a register
          finish    (not specified)                  function call to O1
          finishr   (not specified)                  function call to a register
          jmpi/jmpr (not specified)                  unconditional jump to O1
          ret       (not specified)                  return from subroutine
          retval    c  uc s  us i  ui l  ul p  f  d  move return value
                                                     to register

     Like branch instruction, `jmpi' also returns a value which is to
     be used to compile forward branches. *Note Fibonacci numbers:
     Fibonacci.

Function prolog
     These macros are used to set up the function prolog, in particular
     to declare the number of arguments accepted by a function, and to
     reserve space on the stack to be used for variables.  They accept
     a single numeric argument.

          prolog    (not specified)                  function prolog for O1 args
          leaf      (not specified)                  the same for leaf functions
          allocai   (not specified)                  reserve space on the stack

     Results are undefined when using function calls in a leaf function.

     `allocai' receives the number of bytes to allocate and returns the
     offset from the frame pointer register `FP' to the base of the
     area.  The area is aligned to an `int'; future versions of GNU
     lightning may provide more fine-grained control on the alignment of
     stack-allocated variables.

   As a small appetizer, here is a small function that adds 1 to the
input parameter (an `int').  I'm using an assembly-like syntax here
which is a bit different from the one used when writing real
subroutines with GNU lightning; the real syntax will be introduced in
*Note Generating code at run-time: GNU lightning macros.

     incr:
          leaf      1
     in = arg_i                   ! We have an integer argument
          getarg_i  R0, in        ! Move it to R0
          addi_i    RET, R0, 1    ! Add 1, put result in return value
          ret                     ! And return the result

   And here is another function which uses the `printf' function from
the standard C library to write a number in hexadecimal notation:

     printhex:
          prolog    1
     in = arg_i                    ! Same as above
          getarg_i  R0, in
          prepare   2              ! Begin call sequence for printf
          pusharg_i R0             ! Push second argument
          pusharg_p "%x"           ! Push format string
          finish    printf         ! Call printf
          ret                      ! Return to caller

2.3 Generating code at run-time
===============================

To use GNU lightning, you should include the `lightning.h' file that is
put in your include directory by the `make install' command.  That
include files defines about four hundred public macros (plus others
that are private to GNU lightning), one for each opcode listed above.

   Each of the instructions above translates to a macro.  All you have
to do is prepend `jit_' (lowercase) to opcode names and `JIT_'
(uppercase) to register names.  Of course, parameters are to be put
between parentheses, just like with every other CPP macro.

   This small tutorial presents three examples:

* Menu:

* incr::             A function which increments a number by one
* printf::           A simple function call to printf
* RPN calculator::   A more complex example, an RPN calculator
* Fibonacci::        Calculating Fibonacci numbers

2.3.1 A function which increments a number by one
-------------------------------------------------

Let's see how to create and use the sample `incr' function created in
*Note GNU lightning's instruction set: The instruction set.:

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "lightning.h"

     static jit_insn codeBuffer[1024];

     typedef int (*pifi)(int);    /* Pointer to Int Function of Int */

     int main()
     {
       pifi  incr = (pifi) (jit_set_ip(codeBuffer).iptr);
       int   in;

       jit_leaf(1);                     /*      leaf  1             */
       in = jit_arg_i();                /* in = arg_i               */
       jit_getarg_i(JIT_R0, in);        /*      getarg_i R0         */
       jit_addi_i(JIT_RET, JIT_R0, 1);  /*      addi_i   RET, R0, 1 */
       jit_ret();                       /*      ret                 */

       jit_flush_code(codeBuffer, jit_get_ip().ptr);

       /* call the generated code, passing 5 as an argument */
       printf("%d + 1 = %d\n", 5, incr(5));
       return 0;
     }

   Let's examine the code line by line (well, almost...):

#include "lightning.h"
     You already know about this.  It defines all of GNU lightning's
     macros.

static jit_insn codeBuffer[1024];
     You might wonder about what is `jit_insn'.  It is just a type that
     is defined by GNU lightning.  Its exact definition depends on the
     architecture; in general, defining an array of 1024 `jit_insn's
     allows one to write 100 to 400 GNU lightning instructions
     (depending on the architecture and exact instructions).

typedef int (*pifi)(int);
     Just a handy typedef for a pointer to a function that takes an
     `int' and returns another.

pifi incr = (pifi) (jit_set_ip(codeBuffer).iptr);
     This is the first GNU lightning macro we encounter that does not
     map to an instruction.  It is `jit_set_ip', which takes a pointer
     to an area of memory where compiled code will be put and returns
     the same value, cast to a `union' type whose members are pointers
     to functions returning different C types.  This union is called
     `jit_code' and is defined as follows:

              typedef union jit_code {
                char               *ptr;
                void               (*vptr)();
                char               (*cptr)();
                unsigned char      (*ucptr)();
                short              (*sptr)();
                unsigned short     (*usptr)();
                int                (*iptr)();
                unsigned int       (*uiptr)();
                long               (*lptr)();
                unsigned long      (*ulptr)();
                void *             (*pptr)();
                float              (*fptr)();
                double             (*dptr)();
              } jit_code;

     Any of the members could have been used, since the result is soon
     casted to type `pifi' but, for the sake of clarity, the program
     uses `iptr', a pointer to a function with no prototype and
     returning an `int'.

     Analogous to `jit_set_ip' is `jit_get_ip', which does not modify
     the instruction pointer--it is nothing more than a cast of the
     current IP to `jit_code'.

int       in;
     A footnote in *Note GNU lightning's instruction set: The
     instruction set, under the description of `arg', says that macros
     implementing `arg' return a value--we'll be using this variable to
     store the result of `arg'.

jit_leaf(1);
     Ok, so we start generating code for our beloved function... it will
     accept one argument and won't call any other function.

in = jit_arg_i();
jit_getarg_i(JIT_R0, in);
     We retrieve the first (and only) argument, an integer, and store it
     into the general-purpose register `R0'.

jit_addi_i(JIT_RET, JIT_R0, 1);
     We add one to the content of the register and store the result in
     the return value.

jit_ret();
     This instruction generates a standard function epilog that returns
     the contents of the `RET' register.

jit_flush_code(codeBuffer, jit_get_ip().ptr);
     This instruction is very important.  It flushes the generated code
     area out of the processor's instruction cache, avoiding the
     processor executes bogus data that it happens to find there.  The
     `jit_flush_code' function accepts the first and the last address
     to flush; we use `jit_get_ip' to find out the latter.

printf("%d + 1 = %d", 5, incr(5));
     Calling our function is this simple--it is not distinguishable from
     a normal C function call, the only difference being that `incr' is
     a variable.

   GNU lightning abstracts two phases of dynamic code generation:
selecting instructions that map the standard representation, and
emitting binary code for these instructions.  The client program has
the responsibility of describing the code to be generated using the
standard GNU lightning instruction set.

   Let's examine the code generated for `incr' on the SPARC and x86
architectures (on the right is the code that an assembly-language
programmer would write):

SPARC
              save %sp, -96, %sp
              mov  %i0, %l0                   retl
              add  %l0, 1,  %i0               add %o0, 1, %o0
              ret
              restore
     In this case, GNU lightning introduces overhead to create a
     register window (not knowing that the procedure is a leaf
     procedure) and to move the argument to the general purpose
     register `R0' (which maps to `%l0' on the SPARC).  The former
     overhead could be avoided by teaching GNU lightning about leaf
     procedures (*note Future::); the latter could instead be avoided
     by rewriting the getarg instruction as `jit_getarg_i(JIT_RET,
     in)', which was not done in this example.

x86
              pushl %ebp
              movl  %esp, %ebp
              pushl %ebx
              pushl %esi
              pushl %edi
              movl  8(%ebp), %eax        movl 4(%esp), %eax
              addl  $1, %eax             incl %eax
              popl  %edi
              popl  %esi
              popl  %ebx
              popl  %ebp
              ret                        ret
     In this case, the main overhead is due to the function's prolog and
     epilog, which is nine instructions long on the x86; a hand-written
     routine would not save unused callee-preserved registers on the
     stack.  It is to be said, however, that this is not a problem in
     more complicated uses, because more complex procedure would
     probably use the `V0' through `V2' registers (`%ebx', `%esi',
     `%edi'); in this case, a hand-written routine would have included
     the prolog too.  Also, a ten byte prolog would probably be a small
     overhead in a more complex function.

   In such a simple case, the macros that make up the back-end compile
reasonably efficient code, with the notable exception of prolog/epilog
code.

2.3.2 A simple function call to `printf'
----------------------------------------

Again, here is the code for the example:

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "lightning.h"

     static jit_insn codeBuffer[1024];

     typedef void (*pvfi)(int);      /* Pointer to Void Function of Int */

     int main()
     {
       pvfi          myFunction;             /* ptr to generated code */
       char          *start, *end;           /* a couple of labels */
       int           in;                     /* to get the argument */

       myFunction = (pvfi) (jit_set_ip(codeBuffer).vptr);
       start = jit_get_ip().ptr;
       jit_prolog(1);
       in = jit_arg_i();
       jit_movi_p(JIT_R0, "generated %d bytes\n");
       jit_getarg_i(JIT_R1, in);
       jit_prepare(2);
         jit_pusharg_i(JIT_R1);              /* push in reverse order */
         jit_pusharg_p(JIT_R0);
       jit_finish(printf);
       jit_ret();
       end = jit_get_ip().ptr;

       /* call the generated code, passing its size as argument */
       jit_flush_code(start, end);
       myFunction(end - start);
     }

   The function shows how many bytes were generated.  Most of the code
is not very interesting, as it resembles very closely the program
presented in *Note A function which increments a number by one: incr.

   For this reason, we're going to concentrate on just a few statements.

start = jit_get_ip().ptr;
...
end = jit_get_ip().ptr;
     These two instruction call the `jit_get_ip' macro which was
     mentioned in *Note A function which increments a number by one:
     incr.  too.  In this case we use the only field of `jit_code' that
     is not a function pointer: `ptr', which is a simple `char *'.

jit_movi_p(JIT_R0, "generated %d bytes\n");
     Note the use of the `p' type specifier, which automatically casts
     the second parameter to an `unsigned long' to make the code more
     clear and less cluttered by typecasts.

jit_prepare(2);
jit_pusharg_i(JIT_R1);
jit_pusharg_p(JIT_R0);
jit_finish(printf);
     Once the arguments to `printf' have been put in general-purpose
     registers, we can start a prepare/pusharg/finish sequence that
     moves the argument to either the stack or registers, then calls
     `printf', then cleans up the stack.  Note how GNU lightning
     abstracts the differences between different architectures and
     ABI's - the client program does not know how parameter passing
     works on the host architecture.


File: lightning.info,  Node: RPN calculator,  Next: Fibonacci,  Prev: printf,  Up: GNU lightning macros

2.3.3 A more complex example, an RPN calculator
-----------------------------------------------

We create a small stack-based RPN calculator which applies a series of
operators to a given parameter and to other numeric operands.  Unlike
previous examples, the code generator is fully parameterized and is
able to compile different formulas to different functions.  Here is the
code for the expression compiler; a sample usage will follow.

   Since GNU lightning does not provide push/pop instruction, this
example uses a stack-allocated area to store the data.  Such an area
can be allocated using the macro `jit_allocai', which receives the
number of bytes to allocate and returns the offset from the frame
pointer register `JIT_FP' to the base of the area.  The area is aligned
to an `int'; future versions of GNU lightning may provide more
fine-grained control on the alignment of stack-allocated variables.

   Usually, you will use the `ldxi' and `stxi' instruction to access
stack-allocated variables.  However, it is possible to use operations
such as `add' to compute the address of the variables, and pass the
address around.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "lightning.h"

     typedef int (*pifi)(int);       /* Pointer to Int Function of Int */

     void stack_push(int reg, int *sp)
     {
       jit_stxi_i (*sp, JIT_FP, reg);
       *sp += sizeof (int);
     }

     void stack_pop(int reg, int *sp)
     {
       *sp -= sizeof (int);
       jit_ldxi_i (reg, JIT_FP, *sp);
     }

     pifi compile_rpn(char *expr)
     {
       pifi fn;
       int stack_base, stack_ptr;
       int in;

       fn = (pifi) (jit_get_ip().iptr);
       jit_leaf(1);
       in = jit_arg_i();
       stack_ptr = stack_base = jit_allocai (32 * sizeof (int));

       jit_getarg_i(JIT_R2, in);

       while (*expr) {
         char buf[32];
         int n;
         if (sscanf(expr, "%[0-9]%n", buf, &n)) {
           expr += n - 1;
           stack_push(JIT_R0, &stack_ptr);
           jit_movi_i(JIT_R0, atoi(buf));
         } else if (*expr == 'x') {
           stack_push(JIT_R0, &stack_ptr);
           jit_movi_i(JIT_R0, JIT_R2);
         } else if (*expr == '+') {
           stack_pop(JIT_R1, &stack_ptr);
           jit_addr_i(JIT_R0, JIT_R1, JIT_R0);
         } else if (*expr == '-') {
           stack_pop(JIT_R1, &stack_ptr);
           jit_subr_i(JIT_R0, JIT_R1, JIT_R0);
         } else if (*expr == '*') {
           stack_pop(JIT_R1, &stack_ptr);
           jit_mulr_i(JIT_R0, JIT_R1, JIT_R0);
         } else if (*expr == '/') {
           stack_pop(JIT_R1, &stack_ptr);
           jit_divr_i(JIT_R0, JIT_R1, JIT_R0);
         } else {
           fprintf(stderr, "cannot compile: %s\n", expr);
           abort();
         }
         ++expr;
       }
       jit_movr_i(JIT_RET, JIT_R0);
       jit_ret();
       return fn;
     }

   The principle on which the calculator is based is easy: the stack top
is held in R0, while the remaining items of the stack are held in the
memory area that we allocate with `allocai'.  Compiling a numeric
operand or the argument `x' pushes the old stack top onto the stack and
moves the operand into R0; compiling an operator pops the second
operand off the stack into R1, and compiles the operation so that the
result goes into R0, thus becoming the new stack top.

   This example allocates a fixed area for 32 `int's.  This is not a
problem when the function is a leaf like in this case; in a full-blown
compiler you will want to analyze the input and determine the number of
needed stack slots--a very simple example of register allocation.  The
area is then managed like a stack using `stack_push' and `stack_pop'.

   Try to locate a call to `jit_set_ip' in the source code.  You will
not find one; this means that the client has to manually set the
instruction pointer.  This technique has one advantage and one
drawback.  The advantage is that the client can simply set the
instruction pointer once and then generate code for multiple functions,
one after another, without caring about passing a different instruction
pointer each time; see *Note Re-entrant usage of GNU lightning:
Reentrancy. for the disadvantage.

   Source code for the client (which lies in the same source file)
follows:

     static jit_insn codeBuffer[1024];

     int main()
     {
       pifi c2f, f2c;
       int i;

       jit_set_ip(codeBuffer);
       c2f = compile_rpn("32x9*5/+");
       f2c = compile_rpn("x32-5*9/");
       jit_flush_code(codeBuffer, jit_get_ip().ptr);

       printf("\nC:");
       for (i = 0; i <= 100; i += 10) printf("%3d ", i);
       printf("\nF:");
       for (i = 0; i <= 100; i += 10) printf("%3d ", c2f(i));
       printf("\n");

       printf("\nF:");
       for (i = 32; i <= 212; i += 10) printf("%3d ", i);
       printf("\nC:");
       for (i = 32; i <= 212; i += 10) printf("%3d ", f2c(i));
       printf("\n");
       return 0;
     }

   The client displays a conversion table between Celsius and Fahrenheit
degrees (both Celsius-to-Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit-to-Celsius). The
formulas are, F(c) = c*9/5+32 and C(f) = (f-32)*5/9, respectively.

   Providing the formula as an argument to `compile_rpn' effectively
parameterizes code generation, making it possible to use the same code
to compile different functions; this is what makes dynamic code
generation so powerful.

   The `rpn.c' file in the GNU lightning distribution includes a more
complete (and more complex) implementation of `compile_rpn', which does
constant folding and is able to assemble instructions with an immediate
parameter.  Still, it is based on the same principle and also uses
`allocai' to allocate space for the stack.

2.3.4 Fibonacci numbers
-----------------------

The code in this section calculates a variant of the Fibonacci sequence.
While the traditional Fibonacci sequence is modeled by the recurrence
relation:
          f(0) = f(1) = 1
          f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

the functions in this section calculates the following sequence, which
is more interesting as a benchmark(1):
          nfibs(0) = nfibs(1) = 1
          nfibs(n) = nfibs(n-1) + nfibs(n-2) + 1

   The purpose of this example is to introduce branches.  There are two
kind of branches: backward branches and forward branches.  We'll
present the calculation in a recursive and iterative form; the former
only uses forward branches, while the latter uses both.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "lightning.h"

     static jit_insn codeBuffer[1024];

     typedef int (*pifi)(int);       /* Pointer to Int Function of Int */

     int main()
     {
       pifi      nfibs = (pifi) (jit_set_ip(codeBuffer).iptr);
       int       in;                 /* offset of the argument */
       jit_insn  *ref;               /* to patch the forward reference */

             jit_prolog   (1);
       in =  jit_arg_ui   ();
             jit_getarg_ui(JIT_V0, in);              /* V0 = n */
       ref = jit_blti_ui  (jit_forward(), JIT_V0, 2);
             jit_subi_ui  (JIT_V1, JIT_V0, 1);       /* V1 = n-1 */
             jit_subi_ui  (JIT_V2, JIT_V0, 2);       /* V2 = n-2 */
             jit_prepare(1);
               jit_pusharg_ui(JIT_V1);
             jit_finish(nfibs);
             jit_retval(JIT_V1);                     /* V1 = nfibs(n-1) */
             jit_prepare(1);
               jit_pusharg_ui(JIT_V2);
             jit_finish(nfibs);
             jit_retval(JIT_V2);                     /* V2 = nfibs(n-2) */
             jit_addi_ui(JIT_V1,  JIT_V1,  1);
             jit_addr_ui(JIT_RET, JIT_V1, JIT_V2);   /* RET = V1 + V2 + 1 */
             jit_ret();

       jit_patch(ref);                               /* patch jump */
             jit_movi_i(JIT_RET, 1);                 /* RET = 1 */
             jit_ret();

       /* call the generated code, passing 32 as an argument */
       jit_flush_code(codeBuffer, jit_get_ip().ptr);
       printf("nfibs(%d) = %d", 32, nfibs(32));
       return 0;
     }

   As said above, this is the first example of dynamically compiling
branches.  Branch instructions have three operands: two contains the
values to be compared, while the first is a "label"; GNU lightning
label's are represented as `jit_insn *' values.  Unlike other
instructions (apart from `arg', which is actually a directive rather
than an instruction), branch instructions also return a value which, as
we see in the example above, can be used to compile forward references.

   Compiling a forward reference is a two-step operation.  First, a
branch is compiled with a dummy label, since the actual destination of
the jump is not yet known; the dummy label is returned by the
`jit_forward()' macro.  The value returned by the branch instruction is
saved to be used later.

   Then, when the destination of the jump is reached, another macro is
used, `jit_patch()'. This macro must be called once for *every* point
in which the code had a forward branch to the instruction following
`jit_patch' (in this case a `movi_i' instruction).

   Now, here is the iterative version:

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "lightning.h"

     static jit_insn codeBuffer[1024];

     typedef int (*pifi)(int);       /* Pointer to Int Function of Int */

     int main()
     {
       pifi     nfibs = (pifi) (jit_set_ip(codeBuffer).iptr);
       int      in;                  /* offset of the argument */
       jit_insn *ref;                /* to patch the forward reference */
       jit_insn *loop;               /* start of the loop */

             jit_leaf     (1);
       in =  jit_arg_ui   ();
             jit_getarg_ui(JIT_R2, in);              /* R2 = n */
             jit_movi_ui  (JIT_R1, 1);
       ref = jit_blti_ui  (jit_forward(), JIT_R2, 2);
             jit_subi_ui  (JIT_R2, JIT_R2, 1);
             jit_movi_ui  (JIT_R0, 1);

       loop= jit_get_label();
             jit_subi_ui  (JIT_R2, JIT_R2, 1);       /* decr. counter */
             jit_addr_ui  (JIT_V0, JIT_R0, JIT_R1);  /* V0 = R0 + R1 */
             jit_movr_ui  (JIT_R0, JIT_R1);          /* R0 = R1 */
             jit_addi_ui  (JIT_R1, JIT_V0, 1);       /* R1 = V0 + 1 */
             jit_bnei_ui  (loop, JIT_R2, 0);         /* if (R2) goto loop; */

       jit_patch(ref);                               /* patch forward jump */
             jit_movr_ui  (JIT_RET, JIT_R1);         /* RET = R1 */
             jit_ret      ();

       /* call the generated code, passing 36 as an argument */
       jit_flush_code(codeBuffer, jit_get_ip().ptr);
       printf("nfibs(%d) = %d", 36, nfibs(36));
       return 0;
     }

   This code calculates the recurrence relation using iteration (a
`for' loop in high-level languages).  There is still a forward
reference (indicated by the `jit_forward'/`jit_patch' pair); there are
no function calls anymore: instead, there is a backward jump (the
`bnei' at the end of the loop).

   In this case, the destination address should be known, because the
jumps lands on an instruction that has already been compiled.  However
the program must make a provision and remember the address where the
jump will land.  This is achieved with `jit_get_label', yet another
macro that is much similar to `jit_get_ip' but, instead of a `jit_code'
union, it answers an `jit_insn *' that the branch macros accept.

   Now, let's make one more change: let's rewrite the loop like this:

       ...

       jit_delay(
             jit_movi_ui  (JIT_R1, 1),
       ref = jit_blti_ui  (jit_forward(), JIT_R2, 2));
             jit_subi_ui  (JIT_R2, JIT_R2, 1);

       loop= jit_get_label();
             jit_subi_ui  (JIT_R2, JIT_R2, 1);       /* decr. counter */
             jit_addr_ui  (JIT_V0, JIT_R0, JIT_R1);  /* V0 = R0 + R1 */
             jit_movr_ui  (JIT_R0, JIT_R1);          /* R0 = R1 */
       jit_delay(
             jit_addi_ui  (JIT_R1, JIT_V0, 1),       /* R1 = V0 + 1 */
             jit_bnei_ui  (loop, JIT_R2, 0));        /* if (R2) goto loop; */

       ...

   The `jit_delay' macro is used to schedule delay slots in jumps and
branches.  This is optional, but might lead to performance improvements
in tight inner loops (of course not in a loop that is executed 35
times, but this is just an example).

   `jit_delay' takes two GNU lightning instructions, a "delay
instruction" and a "branch instruction".  Note that the two
instructions must be written in execution order (first the delay
instruction, then the branch instruction), *not* with the branch first.
If the current machine has a delay slot, the delay instruction (or
part of it) is placed in the delay slot after the branch instruction;
otherwise, it emits the delay instruction before the branch
instruction.  The delay instruction must not depend on being executed
before or after the branch.

   Instead of `jit_patch', you can use `jit_patch_at', which takes two
arguments: the first is the same as for `jit_patch', and the second is
the valued to be patched in.  In other words, these two invocations
have the same effect:

       jit_patch (jump_pc);
       jit_patch_at (jump_pc, jit_get_ip ());

   Dual to branches and `jit_patch_at' are `jit_movi_p' and
`jit_patch_movi', which can also be used to implement forward
references.  `jit_movi_p' is carefully implemented to use an encoding
that is as long as possible, so that it can always be patched; in
addition, like branches, it will return an address which is then passed
to `jit_patch_movi'.  The usage of `jit_patch_movi' is similar to
`jit_patch_at'.

   (1) That's because, as is easily seen, the sequence represents the
number of activations of the `nfibs' procedure that are needed to
compute its value through recursion.

2.4 Re-entrant usage of GNU lightning
=====================================

By default, GNU lightning is able to compile different functions at the
same time as long as it happens in different object files, and on the
other hand constrains code generation tasks to reside in a single
object file.

   The reason for this is not apparent, but is easily explained: the
`lightning.h' header file defines its state as a `static' variable, so
calls to `jit_set_ip' and `jit_get_ip' residing in different files
access different instruction pointers.  This was not done without
reason: it makes the usage of GNU lightning much simpler, as it limits
the initialization tasks to the bare minimum and removes the need to
link the program with a separate library.

   On the other hand, multi-threaded or otherwise concurrent programs
require reentrancy in the code generator, so this approach cannot be
the only one.  In fact, it is possible to define your own copy of GNU
lightning's instruction state by defining a variable of type
`jit_state' and `#define'-ing `_jit' to it:

         struct jit_state lightning;
         #define _jit lightning

   You are free to define the `jit_state' variable as you like:
`extern', `static' to a function, `auto', or global.

   This feature takes advantage of an aspect of macros ("cascaded
macros"), which is documented thus in CPP's reference manual:

     A cascade of macros is when one macro's body contains a reference
     to another macro.  This is very common practice.  For example,
          #define BUFSIZE 1020
          #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
     This is not at all the same as defining `TABLESIZE' to be `1020'.
     The `#define' for `TABLESIZE' uses exactly the body you
     specify--in this case, `BUFSIZE'--and does not check to see
     whether it too is the name of a macro; it's only when you use
     `TABLESIZE' that the result of its expansion is checked for more
     macro names.

     This makes a difference if you change the definition of `BUFSIZE'
     at some point in the source file. `TABLESIZE', defined as shown,
     will always expand using the definition of `BUFSIZE' that is
     currently in effect: #define BUFSIZE 1020 #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
     #undef BUFSIZE #define BUFSIZE 37

     Now `TABLESIZE' expands (in two stages) to `37'. (The `#undef' is
     to prevent any warning about the nontrivial redefinition of
     `BUFSIZE'.)

In the same way, `jit_get_label' will adopt whatever definition of
`_jit' is in effect:
     #define	jit_get_label()			(_jit.pc)

   Special care must be taken when functions residing in separate files
must access the same state.  This could be the case, for example, if a
special library contained function for strength reduction of
multiplications to adds & shifts, or maybe of divisions to
multiplications and shifts.  The function would be compiled using a
single definition of `_jit' and that definition would be used whenever
the function would be called.

   Since GNU lightning uses a feature of the preprocessor to obtain
re-entrancy, it makes sense to rely on the preprocessor in this case
too.

   The idea is to pass the current `struct jit_state' to the function:

     static void
     _opt_muli_i(jit, dest, source, n)
          register struct jit_state *jit;
          register int		dest, source, n;
     {
     #define _jit          jit
     ...
     #undef _jit
     }

doing this unbeknownst to the client, using a macro in the header file:

     extern void _opt_muli_i(struct jit_state *, int, int, int);

     #define opt_muli_i(rd, rs, n)	_opt_muli_i(&_jit, (rd), (rs), (n))

2.4.1 Registers
---------------

2.5 Accessing the whole register file
=====================================

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, all GNU lightning back-ends are
guaranteed to have at least six general-purpose integer registers and
six floating-point registers, but many back-ends will have more.

   To access the entire register files, you can use the `JIT_R',
`JIT_V' and `JIT_FPR' macros.  They accept a parameter that identifies
the register number, which must be strictly less than `JIT_R_NUM',
`JIT_V_NUM' and `JIT_FPR_NUM' respectively; the number need not be
constant.  Of course, expressions like `JIT_R0' and `JIT_R(0)' denote
the same register, and likewise for integer callee-saved, or
floating-point, registers.

2.6 Using GNU lightning in your programs
========================================

It is very easy to include GNU lightning's source code (without the
documentation and examples) into your program's distribution so that
people don't need to have it installed in order to use it.

   Here is a step by step explanation of what to do:

  1. Run `lightningize' from your package's main distribution directory.
               lightningize

     This will copy the source code for the GNU lightning back ends
     into the `lightning' directory of your package.

  2. If you're using Automake, you might be pleased to know that
     `Makefile.am' files will be already there.

     If you're not using Automake and `aclocal', instead, you should
     delete the `Makefile.am' files (they are of no use to you) and
     copy the contents of the `lightning.m4' file, found in `aclocal''s
     macro repository (usually `/usr/share/aclocal', to your
     `configure.in' or `acinclude.m4' or `aclocal.m4' file.

  3. Include a call to the `LIGHTNING_CONFIGURE_IF_NOT_FOUND' macro in
     your `configure.in' file.

   `LIGHTNING_CONFIGURE_IF_NOT_FOUND' will first look for a
pre-installed copy of GNU lightning and, if it can be found, it will
use it; otherwise, it will test if there is a back-end for the host
system.  If GNU lightning is already installed, or if the system is
supported by lightning, it will define the `HAVE_LIGHTNING' symbol.

   In addition, an Automake conditional named `HAVE_INSTALLED_LIGHTNING'
will be set if GNU lightning is already installed, which can be used to
set up include paths appropriately.

   Finally, `LIGHTNING_CONFIGURE_IF_NOT_FOUND' accepts two optional
parameters: respectively, an action to be taken if GNU lightning is
available, and an action to be taken if it is not.

3.1 An overview of the porting process
======================================

A particular port of GNU lightning is composed of four files. These
have a common suffix which identifies the port (for example, `i386' or
`ppc'), and a prefix that identifies their function; they are:

   * `asm-SUFFIX.h', which contains the description of the target
     machine's instruction format.  The creation of this file is
     discussed in *Note Creating the run-time assembler: Run-time
     assemblers.

   * `core-SUFFIX.h', which contains the mappings from GNU lightning's
     instruction set to the target machine's assembly language format.
     The creation of this file is discussed in *Note Creating the
     platform-independent layer: Standard macros.

   * `funcs-SUFFIX.h', for now, only contains the definition of
     `jit_flush_code'. The creation of this file is briefly discussed
     in *Note More complex tasks in the platform-independent layer:

   * `fp-SUFFIX.h', which contains the description of the target
     machine's instruction format and the internal macros for doing
     floating point computation. The creation of this file is discussed
     in *Note Implementing macros for floating point: Floating-point
     macros.

   Before doing anything, you have to add the ability to recognize the
new port during the configuration process.  This is explained in *Note
Automatically recognizing the new platform: Adjusting configure.

3.2 Automatically recognizing the new platform
==============================================

Before starting your port, you have to add the ability to recognize the
new port during the configure process.  You only have to run
`config.guess', which you'll find in the main distribution directory,
and note down the first part of the output (up to the first dash).

   Then, in the two files `configure.in' and `lightning.m4', lookup the
line
         case "$host_cpu" in

and, right after it, add the line:
         CPU-NAME)  cpu=FILE-SUFFIX           ;;

where CPU-NAME is the cpu as output by `config.guess', and FILE-SUFFIX
is the suffix that you are going to use for your files (*note An
overview of the porting process: Structure of a port.).

   Now create empty files for your new port:
         touch lightning/asm-xxx.h
         touch lightning/fp-xxx.h
         touch lightning/core-xxx.h
         touch lightning/funcs-xxx.h

and run `configure', which should create the symlinks that are needed
by `lightning.h'.  This is important because it will allow you to use
GNU lightning (albeit in a limited way) for testing even before the
port is completed.

3.3 Creating the run-time assembler
===================================

The run-time assembler is a set of macros whose purpose is to assemble
instructions for the target machine's assembly language, translating
mnemonics to machine language together with their operands.  While a
run-time assembler is not, strictly speaking, part of GNU lightning (it
is a private layer to be used while implementing the standard macros
that are ultimately used by clients), designing a run-time assembler
first allows you to think in terms of assembly language rather than
binary code (ouch!...), making it considerably easier to write the
standard macros.

   Creating a run-time assembler is a tedious process rather than a
difficult one, because most of the time will be spent collecting and
copying information from the architecture's manual.

   Macros defined by a run-time assembler are conventionally named after
the mnemonic and the type of its operands.  Examples took from the
SPARC's run-time assembler are `ADDrrr', a macro that assembles an
`ADD' instruction with three register operands, and `SUBCCrir', which
assembles a `SUBCC' instruction whose second operand is an immediate
and the remaining two are registers.

   The first step in creating the assembler is to pick a convention for
operand specifiers (`r' and `i' in the example above) and for register
names.  On the SPARC, this convention is as follows

`r'
     A register name.  For every `r' in the macro name, a numeric
     parameter `RR' is passed to the macro, and the operand is assembled
     as `%rRR'.

`i'
     An immediate, usually a 13-bit signed integer (with exception for
     instructions such as `SETHI' and branches).  The macros check the
     size of the passed parameter if GNU lightning is configured with
     `--enable-assertions'.

`x'
     A combination of two `r' parameters, which are summed to determine
     the effective address in a memory load/store operation.

`m'
     A combination of an `r' and `i' parameter, which are summed to
     determine the effective address in a memory load/store operation.

   Additional macros can be defined that provide easier access to
register names.  For example, on the SPARC, `_Ro(3)' and `_Rg(5)' map
respectively to `%o3' and `%g5'; on the x86, instead, symbolic
representations of the register names are provided (for example, `_EAX'
and `_EBX').

   CISC architectures sometimes have registers of different sizes-this
is the case on the x86 where `%ax' is a 16-bit register while `%esp' is
a 32-bit one.  In this case, it can be useful to embed information on
the size in the definition of register names.  The x86 machine
language, for example, represents all three of `%bh', `%di' and `%edi'
as 7; but the x86 run-time assemblers defines them with different
numbers, putting the register's size in the upper nybble (for example,
`17h' for `%bh' and `27h' for `%di') so that consistency checks can be
made on the operands' sizes when `--enable-assertions' is used.

   The next important part defines the native architecture's instruction
formats.  These can be as few as ten on RISC architectures, and as many
as fifty on CISC architectures.  In the latter case it can be useful to
define more macros for sub-formats (such as macros for different
addressing modes) or even for sub-fields in an instruction.  Let's see
an example of these macros.

     #define _2i( OP, RD, OP2, IMM)
             _I((_u2 (OP )<<30)  |  (_u5(RD)<<25)  |  (_u3(OP2)<<22)  |
                 _u22(IMM)                                            )

   The name of the macro, `_2i', indicates a two-operand instruction
comprising an immediate operand.  The instruction format is:

      .------.---------.------.-------------------------------------------.
      |  OP  |   RD    | OP2  |               IMM                         |
      |------+---------+------+-------------------------------------------|
      |2 bits|  5 bits |3 bits|             22 bits                       |
      |31-30 |  29-25  | 22-24|              0-21                         |
      '------'---------'------'-------------------------------------------'

   GNU lightning provides macros named `_sXX(OP)' and `_uXX(OP)', where
XX is a number between 1 and 31, which test(1) whether `OP' can be
represented as (respectively) a signed or unsigned integer of the given
size.  What the macro above does, then, is to shift and OR together the
different fields, ensuring that each of them fits the field.

   Here is another definition, this time for the PowerPC architecture.

     #define _X(OP,RD,RA,RB,XO,RC)
             _I((_u6 (OP)<<26)  |  (_u5(RD)<<21)  |  (_u5(RA)<<16)  |
                ( _u5(RB)<<11)  |  (_u10(XO)<<1)  |   _u1(RC)       )

   Here is the bit layout corresponding to this instruction format:

      .--------.--------.--------.--------.---------------------.-------.
      |    OP  |   RD   |   RA   |   RB   |           X0        |   RC  |
      |--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------------------------|
      | 6 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits |         10 bits     | 1 bit |
      | 31-26  | 25-21  | 16-20  | 11-15  |         1-10        |   0   |
      '--------'---------'-------'--------'-----------------------------'

   How do these macros actually generate code? The secret lies in the
`_I' macro, which is one of four predefined macros which actually store
machine language instructions in memory.  They are `_B', `_W', `_I' and
`_L', respectively for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and `long' (either 32-bit
or 64-bit, depending on the architecture) values.

   Next comes another set of macros (usually the biggest) which
represents the actual mnemonics--macros such as `ADDrrr' and `SUBCCrir',
which were cited earlier in this chapter, belong to this set.  Most of
the times, all these macros will do is to use the "instruction format"
macros, specifying the values of the fields in the different instruction
formats.  Let's see a few of these definitions, again taken from the
SPARC assembler:

     #define BAi(DISP)                       _2   (0, 0,  8, 2, DISP)
     #define BA_Ai(DISP)                     _2   (0, 1,  8, 2, DISP)

     #define SETHIir(IMM, RD)                _2i  (0, RD, 4, IMM)

     #define ADDrrr(RS1, RS2, RD)            _3   (2, RD,  0, RS1, 0, 0, RS2)
     #define ADDrir(RS1, IMM, RD)            _3i  (2, RD,  0, RS1, 1,    IMM)
     #define ADDCCrrr(RS1, RS2, RD)          _3   (2, RD, 16, RS1, 0, 0, RS2)
     #define ADDCCrir(RS1, IMM, RD)          _3i  (2, RD, 16, RS1, 1,    IMM)
     #define ANDrrr(RS1, RS2, RD)            _3   (2, RD,  1, RS1, 0, 0, RS2)
     #define ANDrir(RS1, IMM, RD)            _3i  (2, RD,  1, RS1, 1,    IMM)
     #define ANDCCrrr(RS1, RS2, RD)          _3   (2, RD, 17, RS1, 0, 0, RS2)
     #define ANDCCrir(RS1, IMM, RD)          _3i  (2, RD, 17, RS1, 1,    IMM)

   A few things have to be noted.  For example:
   * The SPARC assembly language sometimes uses a comma inside a
     mnemonic (for example, `ba,a').  This symbol is not allowed inside
     a CPP macro name, so it is replaced with an underscore; the same
     is done with the dots found in the PowerPC assembly language (for
     example, `andi.' is defined as `ANDI_rri').

   * It can be useful to group together instructions with the same
     instruction format, as doing this tends to make the source code
     more readable (numbers are put in the same columns).

   * Using an editor without automatic wrap at end of line can be
     useful, since run-time assemblers tend to have very long lines.

   A final touch is to define the synthetic instructions, which are
usually found on RISC machines.  For example, on the SPARC, the `LD'
instruction has two synonyms (`LDUW' and `LDSW') which are defined thus:

     #define LDUWxr(RS1, RS2, RD)            LDxr(RS1, RS2, RD)
     #define LDUWmr(RS1, IMM, RD)            LDmr(RS1, IMM, RD)
     #define LDSWxr(RS1, RS2, RD)            LDxr(RS1, RS2, RD)
     #define LDSWmr(RS1, IMM, RD)            LDmr(RS1, IMM, RD)

   Other common case are instructions which take advantage of registers
whose value is hard-wired to zero, and short-cut instructions which
hard-code some or all of the operands:

     /* Destination is %g0, which the processor never overwrites. */
     #define CMPrr(R1, R2)   SUBCCrrr(R1, R2, 0) /* subcc %r1, %r2, %g0 */

     /* One of the source registers is hard-coded to be %g0. */
     #define NEGrr(R,S)      SUBrrr(0, R, S)     /* sub %g0, %rR, %rS */

     /* All of the operands are hard-coded. */
     #define RET()           JMPLmr(31,8 ,0)     /* jmpl [%r31+8], %g0  */

     /* One of the operands acts as both source and destination */
     #define BSETrr(R,S)     ORrrr(R, S, S)      /* or %rR, %rS, %rS */

   Specific to RISC computers, finally, is the instruction to load an
arbitrarily sized immediate into a register.  This instruction is
usually implemented as one or two basic instructions:

  1. If the number is small enough, an instruction is sufficient (`LI'
     or `ORI' on the PowerPC, `MOV' on the SPARC).

  2. If the lowest bits are all zeroed, an instruction is sufficient
     (`LIS' on the PowerPC, `SETHI' on the SPARC).

  3. Otherwise, the high bits are set first (with `LIS' or `SETHI'),
     and the result is then ORed with the low bits

   Here is the definition of such an instruction for the PowerPC:

     #define MOVEIri(R,I)      (_siP(16,I) ? LIri(R,I) :     \ /* case 1    */
                               (_uiP(16,I) ? ORIrri(R,0,I) : \ /* case 1    */
                               _MOVEIri(R, _HI(I), _LO(I)) ))  /* case 2/3  */

     #define _MOVEIri(H,L,R)  (LISri(R,H), (L ? ORIrri(R,R,L) : 0))

and for the SPARC:

     #define SETir(I,R)      (_siP(13,I) ? MOVir(I,R) : \
     			 _SETir(_HI(I), _LO(I), R))

     #define _SETir(H,L,R)   (SETHIir(H,R), (L ? ORrir(R,L,R) : 0))

   In both cases, `_HI' and `_LO' are macros for internal use that
extract different parts of the immediate operand.

   You should take a look at the run-time assemblers distributed with
GNU lightning before trying to craft your own.  In particular, make
sure you understand the RISC run-time assemblers (the SPARC's is the
simplest) before trying to decypher the x86 run-time assembler, which
is significantly more complex.

3.4 Creating the platform-independent layer
===========================================

The platform-independent layer is the one that is ultimately used by
GNU lightning clients.  Creating this layer is a matter of creating a
hundred or so macros that comprise part of the interface used by the
clients, as described in *Note GNU lightning's instruction set: The
instruction set.

   Fortunately, a number of these definitions are common to the
different platforms and are defined just once in one of the header
files that make up GNU lightning, that is, `core-common.h'.

   Most of the macros are relatively straight-forward to implement (with
a few caveats for architectures whose assembly language only offers
two-operand arithmetic instructions).  This section will cover the
tricky points, before presenting the complete listing of the macros
that make up the platform-independent interface provided by GNU
lightning.

File: lightning.info,  Node: Forward references,  Next: Common features,  Up: Standard macros

3.4.1 Implementing forward references
-------------------------------------

Implementation of forward references takes place in:

   * The branch macros

   * The `jit_patch_at' macros

   Roughly speaking, the branch macros, as seen in *Note Generating
code at run-time: GNU lightning macros, return a value that later calls
to `jit_patch' or `jit_patch_at' use to complete the assembly of the
forward reference.  This value is usually the contents of the program
counter after the branch instruction is compiled (which is accessible
in the `_jit.pc' variable).  Let's see an example from the x86 back-end:

     #define jit_bmsr_i(label, s1, s2)                            \
        (TESTLrr((s1), (s2)), JNZm(label,0,0,0), _jit.pc)

   The `bms' ("branch if mask set") instruction is assembled as the
combination of a `TEST' instruction (bit-wise AND between the two
operands) and a `JNZ' instruction (jump if non-zero).  The macro then
returns the final value of the program counter.

   `jit_patch_at' is one of the few macros that need to possess a
knowledge of the machine's instruction formats.  Its purpose is to
patch a branch instruction (identified by the value returned at the
moment the branch was compiled) to jump to the current position (that
is, to the address identified by `_jit.pc').

   On the x86, the displacement between the jump and the landing point
is expressed as a 32-bit signed integer lying in the last four bytes of
the jump instruction.  The definition of `_jit_patch_at' is:

     #define jit_patch(jump_pc, pv)    (*_PSL((jump_pc) - 4) = \
     				   (pv) - (jump_pc))

   The `_PSL' macro is nothing more than a cast to `long *', and is
used here to shorten the definition and avoid cluttering it with
excessive parentheses.  These type-cast macros are:

   * `_PUC(X)' to cast to a `unsigned char *'.

   * `_PUS(X)' to cast to a `unsigned short *'.

   * `_PUI(X)' to cast to a `unsigned int *'.

   * `_PSL(X)' to cast to a `long *'.

   * `_PUL(X)' to cast to a `unsigned long *'.

   On other platforms, notably RISC ones, the displacement is embedded
into the instruction itself.  In this case, `jit_patch_at' must first
zero out the field, and then OR in the correct displacement.  The SPARC,
for example, encodes the displacement in the bottom 22 bits; in addition
the right-most two bits are suppressed, which are always zero because
instruction have to be word-aligned.

     #define jit_patch_at(delay_pc, pv)   jit_patch_ (((delay_pc) - 1), (pv))

     /* branch instructions return the address of the _delay_
      * instruction--this is just a helper macro that makes the code more
      * readable.
      */
     #define jit_patch_(jump_pc, pv)   (*jump_pc =		    \
     	 (*jump_pc & ~_MASK(22)) |			    \
              ((_UL(pv) - _UL(jump_pc)) >> 2) & _MASK(22))

   This introduces more predefined shortcut macros:
   * `_UC(X)' to cast to a `unsigned char'.

   * `_US(X)' to cast to a `unsigned short'.

   * `_UI(X)' to cast to a `unsigned int'.

   * `_SL(X)' to cast to a `long'.

   * `_UL(X)' to cast to a `unsigned long'.

   * `_MASK(N)' gives a binary number made of N ones.

   Dual to branches and `jit_patch_at' are `jit_movi_p' and
`jit_patch_movi', since they can also be used to implement forward
references.  `jit_movi_p' should be carefully implemented to use an
encoding that is as long as possible, and it should return an address
which is then passed to `jit_patch_movi'.  The implementation of
`jit_patch_movi' is similar to `jit_patch_at'.

3.4.2 Common features supported by `core-common.h'
--------------------------------------------------

The `core-common.h' file contains hundreds of macro definitions which
will spare you defining a lot of things in the files the are specific
to your port.  Here is a list of the features that `core-common.h'
provides.

Support for common synthetic instructions
     These are instructions that can be represented as a simple
     operation, for example a bit-wise AND or a subtraction.
     `core-common.h' recognizes when the port-specific header file
     defines these macros and avoids compiler warnings about redefined
     macros, but there should be no need to define them.  They are:
          #define jit_extr_c_ui(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_s_ui(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_c_ul(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_s_ul(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_i_ul(d, rs)
          #define jit_negr_i(d, rs)
          #define jit_negr_l(d, rs)

Support for the ABI
     All of `jit_prolog', `jit_leaf' and `jit_finish' are not
     mandatory.  If not defined, they will be defined respectively as an
     empty macro, as a synonym for `jit_prolog', and as a synonym for
     `jit_calli'.  Whether to define them or not in the port-specific
     header file, it depends on the underlying architecture's ABI--in
     general, however, you'll need to define at least `jit_prolog'.

Support for uncommon instructions
     These are instructions that many widespread architectures lack.
     `core-common.h' is able to provide default definitions, but they
     are usually inefficient if the hardware provides a way to do these
     operations with a single instruction.  They are extension with sign
     and "reverse subtraction" (that is, REG2=IMM-REG1):
          #define jit_extr_c_i(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_s_i(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_c_l(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_s_l(d, rs)
          #define jit_extr_i_l(d, rs)
          #define jit_rsbi_i(d, rs, is)
          #define jit_rsbi_l(d, rs, is)
          #define jit_rsbi_p(d, rs, is)

Conversion between network and host byte ordering
     These macros are no-ops on big endian systems.  Don't define them
     on such systems; on the other hand, they are mandatory on little
     endian systems.  They are:
          #define jit_ntoh_ui(d, rs)
          #define jit_ntoh_us(d, rs)

Support for a "zero" register
     Many RISC architectures provide a read-only register whose value is
     hard-coded to be zero; this register is then used implicitly when
     referring to a memory location using a single register.  For
     example, on the SPARC, an operand like `[%l6]' is actually
     assembled as `[%l6+%g0]'.  If this is the case, you should define
     `JIT_RZERO' to be the number of this register; `core-common.h'
     will use it to implement all variations of the `ld' and `st'
     instructions.  For example:
          #define jit_ldi_c(d, is)         jit_ldxi_c(d, JIT_RZERO, is)
          #define jit_ldr_i(d, rs)         jit_ldxr_c(d, JIT_RZERO, rs)

     If available, JIT_RZERO is also used to provide more efficient
     definitions of the `neg' instruction (see "Support for common
     synthetic instructions", above).

Synonyms
     `core-common.h' provides a lot of trivial definitions which make
     the instruction set as orthogonal as possible.  For example,
     adding two unsigned integers is exactly the same as adding two
     signed integers (assuming a two's complement representation of
     negative numbers); yet, GNU lightning provides both `jit_addr_i'
     and `jit_addr_ui' macros.  Similarly, pointers and unsigned long
     integers behave in the same way, but GNU lightning has separate
     instruction for the two data types--those that operate on pointers
     usually include a typecast that makes programs clearer.

Shortcuts
     These define "synthetic" instructions whose definition is not as
     trivial as in the case of synonyms, but is anyway standard.  This
     is the case for bitwise NOT (which is implemented by XORing a
     string of ones), "reverse subtraction" between registers (which is
     converted to a normal subtraction with the two source operands
     inverted), and subtraction of an immediate from a register (which
     is converted to an addition).  Unlike `neg' and `ext' (see
     "Support for common synthetic instructions", above), which are
     simply non-mandatory, you must not define these functions.

Support for `long's
     On most systems, `long's and `unsigned long's are the same as,
     respectively, `int's and `unsigned int's.  In this case,
     `core-common.h' defines operations on these types to be synonyms.

`jit_state'
     Last but not least, `core-common.h' defines the `jit_state' type.
     Part of this `struct' is machine-dependent and includes all kinds
     of state needed by the back-end; this part is always accessible in
     a re-entrant way as `_jitl'.  `_jitl' will be of type `struct
     jit_local_state'; this struct must be defined even if no state is
     required.

3.4.3 Supporting scheduling of delay slots
------------------------------------------

Delay slot scheduling is obtained by clients through the `jit_delay'
macro.  However this macro is not to be defined in the
platform-independent layer, because GNU lightning provides a common
definition in `core-common.h'.

   Instead, the platform-independent layer must define another macro,
called `jit_fill_delay_after', which has to exchange the instruction to
be scheduled in the delay slot with the branch instruction.  The only
parameter accepted by the macro is a call to a branch macro, which must
be expanded *exactly once* by `jit_fill_delay_after'.  The client must
be able to pass the return value of `jit_fill_delay_after' to
`jit_patch_at'.

   There are two possible approaches that can be used in
`jit_fill_delay_after'.  They are summarized in the following pictures:

   * The branch instructions assemble a NOP instruction which is then
     removed by `jit_fill_delay_after'.

               before                         |   after
             ---------------------------------+-----------------------------
               ...                            |
               <would-be delay instruction>   |    <branch instruction>
               <branch instruction>           |    <delay instruction>
               NOP                            |           <--- _jit.pc
                        <--- _jit.pc          |

   * The branch instruction assembles the branch so that the delay slot
     is annulled, `jit_fill_delay_after' toggles the bit:

               before                         |   after
             ---------------------------------+-----------------------------
               ...                            |
               <would-be delay instruction>   |    <branch instruction>
               <branch with annulled delay>   |    <delay instruction>
                        <--- _jit.pc          |           <--- _jit.pc

   Don't forget that you can take advantage of delay slots in the
implementation of boolean instructions such as `le' or `gt'.

3.4.4 Supporting arbitrarily sized immediate values
---------------------------------------------------

This is a problem that is endemic to RISC machines.  The basic idea is
to reserve one or two register to represent large immediate values.
Let's see an example from the SPARC:

        addi_i R0, V2, 45         |  addi_i R0, V2, 10000
       ---------------------------+---------------------------
        add    %l5, 45, %l0       |  set    10000, %l6
                                  |  add    %l5, %l6, %l0

   In this case, `%l6' is reserved to be used for large immediates.  An
elegant solution is to use an internal macro which automatically
decides which version is to be compiled.

   Beware of register conflicts on machines with delay slots.  This is
the case for the SPARC, where `%l7' is used instead for large
immediates in compare-and-branch instructions.  So the sequence

        jit_delay(
           jit_addi_i(JIT_R0, JIT_V2, 10000),
           jit_blei_i(label, JIT_R1, 20000)
        );

is assembled this way:

        set 10000, %l6       ! prepare immediate for add
        set 20000, %l7       ! prepare immediate for cmp
        cmp %l1, %l7
        ble label
        add %l5, %l6, %l0    ! delay slot


   Note that using `%l6' in the branch instruction would have given an
incorrect result--`R0' would have been filled with the value of
`V2+20000' rather than `V2+10000'.

3.4.5 Implementing the ABI
--------------------------

Implementing the underlying architecture's ABI is done in the macros
that handle function prologs and epilogs and argument passing.

   Let's look at the prologs and epilogs first.  These are usually
pretty simple and, what's more important, with constant content--that
is, they always generate exactly the same instruction sequence.  Here is
an example:

               SPARC                        x86
               save %sp, -96, %sp           push %ebp
                                            push %ebx
                                            push %esi
                                            push %edi
                                            movl %esp, %ebp
               ...                          ...
               ret                          popl %edi
               restore                      popl %esi
                                            popl %ebx
                                            popl %ebp
                                            ret

   The registers that are saved (`%ebx', `%esi', `%edi') are mapped to
the `V0' through `V2' registers in the GNU lightning instruction set.

   Argument passing is more tricky.  There are basically three cases(1):
Register windows
     Output registers are different from input registers--the prolog
     takes care of moving the caller's output registers to the callee's
     input registers.  This is the case with the SPARC.

Passing parameters via registers
     In this case, output registers are the same as input registers.
     The program must take care of saving input parameters somewhere
     (on the stack, or in non-argument registers).  This is the case
     with the PowerPC.

All the parameters are passed on the stack
     This case is by far the simplest and is the most common in CISC
     architectures, like the x86 and Motorola 68000.

   In all cases, the port-specific header file will define two variable
for private use--one to be used by the caller during the
`prepare'/`pusharg'/`finish' sequence, one to be used by the callee,
specifically in the `jit_prolog' and `jit_arg' macros.

   Let's look again, this time with more detail, at each of the cases.

Register windows
     `jit_finish' is the same as `jit_calli', and is defined in
     `core-common.h' (*note Common features supported by
     `core-common.h': Common features.).

          #define jit_prepare_i(numargs)  (_jitl.pusharg = _Ro(numargs))
          #define jit_pusharg_i(rs)       (--_jitl.pusharg,         \
                                           MOVrr((rs), _jitl.pusharg))

     Remember that arguments pushing takes place in reverse order, thus
     giving a pre-decrement (rather than post-increment) in
     `jit_pusharg_i'.

     Here is what happens on the callee's side:

          #define jit_arg_c()           (_jitl.getarg++)
          #define jit_getarg_c(rd, ofs) jit_extr_c_i  ((rd), (ofs))
          #define jit_prolog(numargs)   (SAVErir(JIT_SP, -96, JIT_SP), \
                                         _jitl.getarg = _Ri(0))

     The `jit_arg' macros return nothing more than a register index,
     which is then used by the `jit_getarg' macros.  `jit_prolog'
     resets the counter used by `jit_arg' to zero; the `numargs'
     parameter is not used. It is sufficient for `jit_leaf' to be a
     synonym for `jit_prolog'.

Passing parameter via registers
     The code is almost the same as that for the register windows case,
     but with an additional complexity--`jit_arg' will transfer the
     argument from the input register to a non-argument register so that
     function calls will not clobber it.  The prolog and epilog code
     can then become unbearably long, up to 20 instructions on the PPC;
     a common solution in this case is that of "trampolines".

     The prolog does nothing more than put the function's actual
     address in a caller-preserved register and then call the
     trampoline:
                 mflr    r0                 ! grab return address
                 movei   r10, trampo_2args  ! jump to trampoline
                 mtlr    r10
                 blrl
          here:  mflr    r31                ! r31 = address of epilog
                 ...actual code...
                 mtlr    r31                ! return to the trampoline
                 blr

     In this case, `jit_prolog' does use its argument containing the
     number of parameters to pick the appropriate trampoline. Here,
     `trampo_2args' is the address of a trampoline designed for
     2-argument functions.

     The trampoline executes the prolog code, jumps to the contents of
     `r10', and upon return from the subroutine it executes the epilog
     code.

All the parameters are passed on the stack
     `jit_pusharg' uses a hardware push operation, which is commonly
     available on CISC machines (where this approach is most likely
     followed).  Since the stack has to be cleaned up after the call,
     `jit_prepare_i' remembers how many parameters have been put there,
     and `jit_finish' adjusts the stack pointer after the call.

          #define jit_prepare_i(numargs) (_jitl.args += (numargs))
          #define jit_pusharg_i(rs)      PUSHLr(rs)
          #define jit_finish(sub)        (jit_calli((sub)),              \
                                         ADDLir(4 * _jitl.args, JIT_SP), \
                                         _jitl.numargs = 0)

     Note the usage of `+=' in `jit_prepare_i'.  This is done so that
     one can defer the popping of the arguments that were saved on the
     stack ("stack pollution").  To do so, it is sufficient to use
     `jit_calli' instead of `jit_finish' in all but the last call.

     On the caller's side, `arg' returns an offset relative to the
     frame pointer, and `getarg' loads the argument from the stack:

          #define jit_getarg_c(rd, ofs) jit_ldxi_c((rd), _EBP, (ofs));
          #define jit_arg_c()           ((_jitl.frame += sizeof(int) \
                                                      -  sizeof(int))

     The `_jitl.frame' variable is initialized by `jit_prolog' with the
     displacement between the value of the frame pointer (`%ebp') and
     the address of the first parameter.

   These schemes are the most used, so `core-common.h' provides a way
to employ them automatically.  If you do not define the `jit_getarg_c'
macro and its companions, `core-common.h' will presume that you intend
to pass parameters through either the registers or the stack.

   If you define `JIT_AP', stack-based parameter passing will be
employed and the `jit_getarg' macros will be defined like this:

     #define jit_getarg_c(reg, ofs)  jit_ldxi_c((reg), JIT_AP, (ofs));

   In other words, the `jit_arg' macros (which are still to be defined
by the platform-specific back-end) shall return an offset into the stack
frame.  On the other hand, if you don't define `JIT_AP', register-based
parameter passing will be employed and the `jit_arg' macros shall
return a register number; in this case, `jit_getarg' will be
implemented in terms of `jit_extr' and `jit_movr' operations:

     #define jit_getarg_c(reg, ofs)		jit_extr_c_i  ((reg), (ofs))
     #define jit_getarg_i(reg, ofs)		jit_movr_i    ((reg), (ofs))

   (1) For speed and ease of implementation, GNU lightning does not
currently support passing some of the parameters on the stack and some
in registers.

3.5 More complex tasks in the platform-independent layer
========================================================

There is actually a single function that you *must* define in the
`funcs-SUFFIX.h' file, that is, `jit_flush_code'.

   As explained in *Note Generating code at run-time: GNU lightning
macros, its purpose is to flush part of the processor's instruction
cache (usually the part of memory that contains the generated code),
avoiding the processor executing bogus data that it happens to find in
the cache.  The `jit_flush_code' function takes the first and the last
address to flush.

   On many processors (for example, the x86 and the all the processors
in the 68k family up to the 68030), it is not even necessary to flush
the cache.  In this case, the contents of the file will simply be

     #ifndef __lightning_funcs_h
     #define __lightning_funcs_h

     #define jit_flush_code(dest, end)

     #endif /* __lightning_core_h */

   On other processors, flushing the cache is necessary for proper
behavior of the program; in this case, the file will contain a proper
definition of the function.  However, we must make yet another
distinction.

   On some processors, flushing the cache is obtained through a call to
the operating system or to the C run-time library.  In this case, the
definition of `jit_flush_code' will be very simple: two examples are
the Alpha and the 68040. For the Alpha the code will be:
     #define jit_flush_code(dest, end) \
             __asm__ __volatile__("call_pal 0x86");

and, for the Motorola
     #define jit_flush_code(start, end) \
             __clear_cache((start), (end))

   As you can see, the Alpha does not even need to pass the start and
end address to the function.  It is good practice to protect usage of
the GNU CC-specific `__asm__' directive by relying on the preprocessor.
For example:

     #if !defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__GNUG__)
     #error Go get GNU C, I do not know how to flush the cache
     #error with this compiler.
     #else
     #define jit_flush_code(dest, end) \
             __asm__ __volatile__("call_pal 0x86");
     #endif

   GNU lightning's configuration process tries to compile a dummy file
that includes `lightning.h', and gives a warning if there are problem
with the compiler that is installed on the system.

   In more complex cases, you'll need to write a full-fledged function.
Don't forget to make it `static', otherwise you'll have problems
linking programs that include `lightning.h' multiple times. An example,
taken from the `funcs-ppc.h' file, is:

     #ifndef __lightning_funcs_h
     #define __lightning_funcs_h

     #if !defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__GNUG__)
     #error Go get GNU C, I do not know how to flush the cache
     #error with this compiler.
     #else
     static void
     jit_flush_code(start, end)
          void       *start;
          void       *end;
     {
       register char *dest = start;

       for (; dest <= end; dest += SIZEOF_CHAR_P)
         __asm__ __volatile__
           ("dcbst 0,%0; sync; icbi 0,%0; isync"::"r"(dest));
     }
     #endif

     #endif /* __lightning_funcs_h */

   The `funcs-SUFFIX.h' file is also the right place to put helper
functions that do complex tasks for the `core-SUFFIX.h' file.  For
example, the PowerPC assembler defines `jit_prolog' as a function and
puts it in that file (for more information, *note Implementing the
ABI::).  Take special care when defining such a function, as explained
in *Note Reentrant usage of GNU lightning: Reentrancy.

4 The future of GNU lightning
*****************************

Presented below is the set of tasks that I feel need to be performed to
make GNU lightning a more fully functional, viable system.  They are
presented in no particular order.  I would _very much_ welcome any
volunteers who would like to help with the implementation of one or
more of these tasks.  Please write to me, Paolo Bonzini, at
<bonzini@gnu.org> if you are interested in adding your efforts to the
GNU lightning project.

   Tasks:
   * The most important task to make GNU lightning more widely usable
     is to retarget it.  Although currently supported architectures
     (x86, SPARC, PowerPC) are certainly some of the most widely used,
     GNU lightning could be ported to others--namely, the Alpha and
     MIPS architectures.

   * Another interesting task is to allow the instruction stream to grow
     dynamically.  This is a problem because not all architectures allow
     to write position independent code.(1)

   * Optimize leaf procedures on the SPARC.  This involves using the
     output registers (`%oX') instead of the local registers (`%lX')
     when writing leaf procedures;  the problem is, leaf procedures
     also receive parameters in the output registers, so they would be
     overwritten by write accesses to general-purpose registers.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The x86's absolute jumps, for example, are actually slow
indirect jumps, and need a register.

******************

As far as I know, the first general-purpose portable dynamic code
generator is DCG, by Dawson R. Engler and T. A. Proebsting.  Further
work by Dawson R. Engler resulted in the VCODE system; unlike DCG,
VCODE used no intermediate representation and directly inspired GNU
lightning.

   Thanks go to Ian Piumarta, who kindly accepted to release his own
program CCG under the GNU General Public License, thereby allowing GNU
lightning to use the run-time assemblers he had wrote for CCG.  CCG
provides a way of dynamically assemble programs written in the
underlying architecture's assembly language.  So it is not portable,
yet very interesting.

   I also thank Steve Byrne for writing GNU Smalltalk, since GNU
lightning was first developed as a tool to be used in GNU Smalltalk's
dynamic translator from bytecodes to native code.
