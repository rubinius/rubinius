# 
# Ping contains routines to test for the reachability of remote hosts.
# Currently the only routine implemented is pingecho().
#
# Ping.pingecho uses a TCP echo (not an ICMP echo) to determine if the
# remote host is reachable. This is usually adequate to tell that a remote
# host is available to telnet, ftp, or ssh to.
#
# Warning: Ping.pingecho may block for a long time if DNS resolution is
# slow. Requiring 'resolv-replace' allows non-blocking name resolution.
#
# Usage:
# 
#   require 'ping'
#
#   puts "'jimmy' is alive and kicking" if Ping.pingecho('jimmy', 10)
#
module Ping

  # 
  # Return true if we can open a connection to the hostname or IP address
  # +host+ on port +service+ (which defaults to the "echo" port) waiting up
  # to +timeout+ seconds.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   require 'ping'
  #
  #   Ping.pingecho "google.com", 10, 80
  #
  def pingecho(host, timeout=10, service="echo")
