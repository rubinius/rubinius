## The Rubinius Language Platform

Rubinius is a modern language platform that supports a number of programming
languages.

Rubinius includes a bytecode virtual machine, generational garbage collector,
and just-in-time (JIT) native machine code compiler. Rubinius provides
concurrency support via native OS threads with no global interpreter lock.

Rubinius runs on Mac OS X and many Unix/Linux operating systems.  Microsoft
Windows is not yet supported.

### Code of Conduct

Participation in the Rubinius project is governed by the Rubinius [Code of
Conduct](http://rubinius.com/code-of-conduct/).

### The Ruby Programming Language

Many popular Ruby applications, like Rails, run on Rubinius, which aims to be
compatible with Ruby version 2.2.

Rubinius includes a Ruby parser, Ruby bytecode compiler, Ruby core library,
and C-API compatibility for native C extensions. The Ruby core library is
written almost entirely in Ruby. The Ruby bytecode compiler and other tools,
such as the debugger, are also written in Ruby.  Rubinius provides the
standard Ruby libraries, with the following exceptions:

* Continuation
* Ripper
* TracePoint
* Tracer

The following Ruby features are not supported on Rubinius:

* Refinements
* $SAFE levels
