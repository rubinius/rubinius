# Reporting security issues

We care deeply about providing a secure Ruby environment for running your code.
If you find a security issue, please send an email to [security@rubini.us](mailto:security@rubini.us). In
order to keep your message safe, you can use our public key to send the report
to us.

The public key can be found in the Rubinius repository as [security.pub](security.pub), on the website at [http://rubini.us/security.pub](http://rubini.us/security.pub), and
in the [MIT PGP database](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x0F7D2F9537F9880C).

We will do our best to respond to you within 72 hours and will work with you
to create a fix for the issue. Sending an email to [security@rubini.us](mailto:security@rubini.us) will not
result in a public disclosure. We will work with you for on a public disclosure
after we have a fix ready.

For security issues for extensions that are copies from CRuby, please report
them there directly. The instructions can be found at [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/security/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/security/).
We track those issues as well and are informed by their security team. This
makes sure Rubinius also gets updated with these security fixes.
